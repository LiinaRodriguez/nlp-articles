Introduction: Primary tumours secrete large amounts
of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which play critical roles
in preparing distant sites for a pre-metastatic niche
formation, thereby promoting metastasis and even
determining metastatic organotropism. Whether bio-
genesis, secretion rates and organotropism of EVs are
linked remains unknown. We have recently shown that
Ral GTPases control EVs secretion in nematodes as
well as in mouse mammary tumour cells (Hyenne et
al. JCB 2015). Since both RalA and RalB are overex-
pressed or over-activated in various human cancers, we
aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which these
two GTPases control EVs secretion and to determine
how this affects metastatic progression, with a focus on
breast cancer.
Methods: We used 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma
cells knocked down for either RalA or RalB and deter-
mined their ability to induce orthotopic tumours and
metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. In vitro, we
investigated EV secretion mechanisms using confocal
and electron microscopy (EM). EVs were isolated
either by UC or SEC and characterized by NTA, EM,
RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. The function
of EVs was assessed using a transwell assay. Finally, we
tracked the organotropism of fluorescently labelled EVs
and their capacity to induce pre-metastatic niches in
mice.
Results: We show that RalA and RalB promote lung
metastasis of breast cancer cells in mice without affecting
their invasive behaviours. We found that RalA and RalB
control the biogenesis of exosomes, by acting on the
formation
of
multi-vesicular
bodies
though
the
phospholipase PLD1. As a consequence, knock down of
RalA or RalB reduces the levels of secreted EVs and
modifies their RNA and protein contents. These differ-
ences alter the pro-tumoural function of EVs, as demon-
strated with an in vitro permeability test. Importantly, we
show in vivo that EVs from RalA or RalB depleted cells
have a decreased lung organotropism and, as a conse-
quence, are less efficient in priming lung metastasis.
Finally, we show that high expression of RalA or RalB
is associated with a bad prognosis in human breast cancer
patients.
Summary/Conclusion: Altogether, our study identifies
Ral GTPases as central molecules linking the mechan-
isms of EVs secretion, their dissemination and their
capacity to promote metastasis.

Introduction: Tetraspanin Tspan8 is a transmembrane
protein that exhibits a unique expression pattern, being
overexpressed in many cancer types, but undetectable
in most healthy tissues. Although there is increasing
evidence of an effect of Tspan8 in invasion, metastasis,
and regulation of extracellular vesicle cargo, the mole-
cular
mechanisms
of
Tspan8
are
yet
not
fully
understood.
Methods: To study the function of Tspan8, we have
established a fibrosarcoma model consisting of the
parental cell line (HT1080) and its derivatives expres-
sing
Tspan8
(HT1080-Tspan8)

different fluorescent tags or tag-free. Life imaging,
STED and STORM microscopy were used to determine
the intracellular localization of Tspan8. Co-immuno-
precipitation from nuclei lysates was performed to
detect direct and indirect interacting partners of
Tspan8. Small EVs were purified from cell-conditioned
media using SEC and subjected to mass spectroscopy
and NGS for a comprehensive comparative analysis of
the proteome and transcriptome of the EVs.
Results: The results of the proteome analysis showed a
strong effect in the protein cargo of EVs upon Tspan8
expression. Remarkably, among 20 of the most regu-
lated targets, several histones and ribosomal proteins
were enriched in the EVs derived from HT1080-
Tspan8 cells. In line with this finding, life imaging
and super-resolution microscopy revealed that, while
a majority of the intracellular Tspan8 is located on the
cell membrane or intracellular membranes, -as it is
known for other tetraspanins-, a portion of Tspan8 is
located on the nuclear envelope. In fact, several his-
tones co-immunoprecipitated with Tspan8, indicating
their interaction.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data show that the expres-
sion of Tspan8 in the tumour cells greatly impacts EV
cargo. Moreover, localization of Tspan8 on the nuclear
envelope, together with the enhanced recruitment of
nuclear and ribosomal proteins to the EVs, suggests a
new mechanism of action of Tspan8.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) modulate
tissue development, regeneration and disease through
the transfer of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids
between cells. Currently, the mechanism of cytosolic
delivery of EV cargo is largely unknown. Here, we
unravel how EVs release their cargo in recipient cells.
Methods: EVs were isolated from GFP-CD63 and
CD63-RFP expressing HEK293 T cells by ultracentri-
fugation. GFP-CD63 and CD63-RFP EVs were added
to HEK293 T cells stably expressing anti-GFP fluobody
and fluorescently tagged galectin-3, respectively. CLEM
and fluorescence microscopy were employed to visua-
lize fluorescent markers in recipient cells. Bafilomycin
A1 and U18666A were used to inhibit endosomal acid-
ification
and
cholesterol
export
from
lysosomes,
respectively.
Results: Fluorescent galectin-3 which binds to beta-
galactosides present at the luminal side of endosomes
was used to detect endosomal permeabilization. The
absence of galectin-3 recruitment to endosomes in
presence of CD63-RFP EVs showed that endosome
permeabilization is not the mechanism behind EV
cargo release. GFP-CD63 EV addition to cells expres-
sing anti-GFP fluobodies resulted in the formation of
fluobody punctae, reflecting cytosolic exposure of EV
cargo. Subsequent CLEM of the fluobody punctae
revealed endosomes as the underlying cellular com-
partments from where cargo release takes place.
Neutralization of endosomal pH and accumulation of
endosomal cholesterol blocked cargo release, showing
that EV cargo release is dependent on endosomal pH
and cholesterol level.
Summary/Conclusion:
We
show
that
genetically
encoded cytosolic probes and CLEM offer an excellent
approach to study both the mechanism and efficiency
of EV cargo release in cells. We provide experimental
evidence
that
EV
cargo
release
occurs
from
endosomes.

healthy humans. To determine cut-off values for diag-
noses, reference intervals of EVs in plasma are needed.
To establish such reference intervals, (1) a significant
number of healthy donors should be included, (2) the
presence of non-EV particles, residual platelets, lipo-
proteins, and haemolysis should be quantified, (3) flow
cytometry signals should be in SI units. The long-term
aim of this study is to determine reference intervals of
EV concentrations in human plasma within known
dynamic ranges of the detectors.
Methods: (1) To establish a clinical reference, we col-
lected blood from 224 healthy volunteers and prepared
platelet-free plasma. (2) We performed quality control
measurements including residual platelet count, serum
index, and lipid spectrum. (3) We measured all samples
by flow cytometry (Apogee A60-Micro) and used cus-
tom software (MATLAB R2018b) to automate calibra-
tion of all signals and data processing. Scatter signals
were calibrated in comparable units of scattering cross-
section (nm2) and diameter (nm). Fluorescence signals
were calibrated in units of molecules of equivalent
soluble fluorophores (MESF).
Results: The quality controls showed that most residual
platelet concentrations ranged from 10^5 to 10^6 per
mL except for one outlier, while the serum index and
lipid spectrum were normally distributed. Preliminary
results of the first 21 donors analysed, show that within
the EV size range of 162–1,000 nm, the median con-
centration
of
CD61+
EVs
is
3.9∙10^8
per
mL
(APC>150 MESF), CD62p+ EVs is 1.1∙10^7 per mL
(PE>83 MESF), CD235a+ EVs is 5.2∙10^7 per mL
(PE>123 MESF), and CD45+ EVs is 1.8∙10^7 per mL
(APC>91 MESF).
Summary/Conclusion: We have developed reliable
procedures for establishing reference intervals of EV
concentrations, within a well-defined size and fluores-
cence intensity range, in human plasma by flow cyto-
metry. We are currently applying these procedures to
224 samples to obtain, for the first time, EV reference
intervals for human plasma.

extracellular vesicles from plasma

Introduction: Purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs)
from complex biological fluids is a critical step for
reliable
EV
analysis.
Plasma
lipoprotein
particles
(LPPs) are a significant confounding factor as they
outnumber EVs >10,000-fold. Given their size overlap,
LPPs cannot be completely removed using standard
size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). We noticed the
contrast in surface charge properties between EVs (-)
and ApoB100-containing LPPs (+). Exploiting these
charge discrepancies, we combined ion exchange in
tandem with size-exclusion chromatography to obtain
an LPP-depleted EV population.
Methods: The dual-mode chromatography (DMC) col-
umn was constructed as a layered combination of size-
exclusion and ion exchange resins. DMC performance for
EV enrichment from plasma samples was compared to
standard SEC by Western blot (CD63 and ApoA1),
ELISA (ApoB100), nanoparticle tracking analysis and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additional
analytical methods included single vesicle imaging and
integrated magnetoelectrochemical exosome (iMEX)
assay.
Results: The DMC strategy removed the majority of
plasma LPPs: >97% of high-density lipoprotein/HDL
(similar to SEC) and >99% of (very) low-density lipo-
proteins/(V)LDL (>60-fold more efficient than SEC).
Additionally, applying DMC resulted in a relatively
high EV isolation yield. TEM provided qualitative con-
firmation
of
LPP
removal
after
DMC
operation.
Furthermore, DMC-prepared samples led to better ana-
lytical outcomes in single vesicle imaging and iMEX.
DMC operation was simple, fast (15 min/sample) and
equipment-free (i.e. gravity-driven).
Summary/Conclusion: DMC is a novel, single-step
chromatography approach for EV enrichment. It pro-
duced enriched EV populations and improved outcome
of EV immunoassays by lowering biological back-
ground. We envision further investigations with differ-
ent biofluids and analytical modalities (e.g., nucleic
acid detection) to broaden its applicability. Such efforts
would further confirm DMC as a powerful EV pre-
paration strategy that can seamlessly replace the cur-
rent SEC-based EV isolation.

physiological functions since contamination of EV pre-
parations with non-EV proteins can lead to incorrect
conclusions about their biological activities. We have
developed a new method termed tangential flow for
analyte capture (TFAC) using ultrathin nanomem-
branes to purify extracellular vesicles from pure, highly
complex biological fluids such as blood plasma, result-
ing
in
a
new
method
for
extracellular
vesicle
purification.
Methods:
The
TFF
microfluidic
devices
are
assembled through a layer stack process using pat-
terned Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets with the
membranes sandwiched between top and bottom
channels. Undiluted plasma was tested in both nor-
mal flow filtration (NFF) and tangential flow filtra-
tion (TFF) modes on ultrathin nanomembranes. We
have utilized a pore patterning technique called
nanosphere lithography (NSL) that uses close-pack-
ing of nanoscale beads to pattern pores in an ultra-
thin membrane.
Results: NFF of undiluted plasma resulted in a protein
cake of ~8 μm on the membrane, which prevented
further transport across the membrane and EVs were
buried in the formed cake that were impossible to
identify. However, TFAC as a modified version of
TFF, led to capturing CD63 positive EVs on the pores
of the membrane with little evidence of protein fouling.
NSL allows us to fabricate nanopockets (bowls with
a single pore at the base) with various diameter, depth
and pore diameter. Using NSL, we further utilize nano-
pocket membranes to purify EV samples in TFAC
devices.
This
nanomanufacturing
technology
will
allow us to pattern nanopockets with various diameter,
depth and pore diameter which increases the efficiency
of capturing of EVs. Furthermore, nanopockets can be
modified and coated by specific EV markers to capture
different subpopulation of EVs based on size and affi-
nity and further allows identifying the phenotypic sub-
sets of EVs by combining both size and affinity-based
techniques.
Summary/Conclusion: We have developed a method
for the capture and release of nanoparticles such as EVs
called TFAC using ultrathin nanomembranes. NSL
technology can be applied to fabricate nanopockets
with different physical and biochemical properties.
Utilizing nanopocket membranes in TFAC system
will allow us to separate different subpopulations of
EVs based on size and affinity.

Introduction: Urinary extracellular vesicles (EVs) and
their RNA cargo are a novel source of biomarkers for
various diseases, however non-vesicular RNA (e.g.
associated with proteins) is also present within urine.
This study aimed to identify the optimal method for
isolating and enriching EVs from human urine prior to
small RNA analysis.
Methods: Three EV concentration methods, ultracen-
trifugation (UC); a precipitation-based kit (PK); and
ultrafiltration (UF), were compared using 50 mL ali-
quots of pooled healthy volunteer urine. EVs were then
separated from protein contaminants by size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC). Presence of EVs was con-
firmed
by
transmission
electron
microscopy
and
Western blotting, and EVs were quantified using nano-
particle tracking analysis (NTA). Small RNA content of
concentrated urine and fractions obtained by SEC (EVs
and
proteins)
were
evaluated
with
the
Agilent
Bioanalyzer small RNA chip.
Results: EV recovery following SEC of concentrated
samples was 35–78%, however particle: protein ratio
(indicating EV purity) was approximately 10x greater
after SEC, regardless of the concentrating method used.
UF+SEC yielded the highest number of EVs (per mL of
urine) compared with PK+SEC and UC+SEC. Small
RNA analysis from UF-concentrated urine (prior to
SEC treatment) identified peaks at 20 nucleotides (nt)
and 60 nt. Following SEC, RNA analysis indicated that
EV fractions contained mostly small RNA of ~60 nt,
whereas the protein factions contained small RNA of
~20 nt in size (consistent with miRNAs).
Summary/Conclusion: UF+SEC provided the best bal-
ance between EV recovery (per mL urine) and particle:
protein ratio. These data indicate that most of the 20 nt
sized RNAs, presumably miRNAs, are not within EVs
in urine. EV preparations obtained after UC, PK and
SEC (regardless of concentrating method) contain pre-
dominantly ~60 nt sized small RNA. These data outline
the importance of removing non-vesicular proteins and
RNA from urine EV preparations prior to small RNA
analysis.

Introduction: The reproducibility of extracellular vesi-
cle (EV) research has been hampered by the infinite
number of separation and measurement techniques
and the lack of appropriate reference materials (Van
Deun et al., Nat Methods, 2017). Recombinant extra-
cellular vesicles (rEV) were developed as a biological
reference
material
to
overcome
these
limitations
(Geeurickx et al. Nat Comm 2019). Since rEV have
EV-like physical an biochemical characteristics and as
they are trackable and distinguishable from sample EV
they can be used as a spike-in material for data normal-
ization and method development, and as a quality
control. We used rEV to optimize EV separation by
asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4).
Methods: An AF4 long channel column with a frit inlet
driven by the eclipse system (Wyatt) was coupled to a
UV
detector
(Shimadzu),
MALS
Dawn
Helios-II
(Wyatt) and fluorescent detector (Agilent). A spacer
of 350 µm and a regenerated cellulose membrane of
10 kDa were used. PBS supplemented with 0.02%
NaN3 was used as a running buffer. Light scatter pro-
files and UV profiles were analysed as well as the
fluorescent emission spectrum as the rEV are GFP
positive. Fractions were collected and analysed by
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western
blot. We also estimated the repeatability and reprodu-
cibility of the AF4 technique by light scatter and fluor-
escence profiles as well as the recovery efficiency
by NTA.
Results: In a first step 4*10^10 rEV isolated from
conditioned medium by a velocity gradient were
injected in the AF4 system to optimize the EV char-
acterization protocol. Later concentrated conditioned
medium was spiked with 1*10^11 rEV and injected in
the AF4 column to optimize EV separation from non-
EV contaminants. The most optimal separation proto-
col was obtained by varying detector and cross-flow
settings. This protocol shows elution of monodisperse
particles at each time point and size distribution esti-
mations by AF4 correspond to size determination by
NTA and electron microscopy.
Summary/Conclusion: We were able to optimize the
AF4 protocol for characterization of EV by AF4 as well
as for separation of EV from crude conditioned med-
ium samples by using rEV. We demonstrate that rEV
are suitable for method development and that AF4 has
high potential as an EV separation technique.

Comparative evaluation of EV isolation methods for EV subpopulation
analysis in human urine, plasma and cell culture media
Liang Dong, Richard Zieren, Kengo Horie, Sarah Amend and Kenneth Pienta
The Brady Urological Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Baltimore, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mem-
brane-enclosed particles of variable sizes that are
released by any cell types to the extracellular space
and are identified in all body fluids. A shortcoming in
EV research is the lack of standardized isolation pro-
tocol for various sample types, resulting in heteroge-
neous outcomes in downstream analyses. In this study,
we compared the EV isolation purity and efficiency
among ultracentrifugation (UC), precipitation, size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a microfluidic
tangential flow filtration device (Exodisc) in human
plasma, urine and cell culture media (CCM).
Methods: All EVs were isolated by different isolation
methods and characterized per MISEV2018 guidelines.
Single-particle
interferometric
reflectance
imaging
senor (SP-IRIS) with optional fluorescence and nano-
flow (nFCM) were used for single particle analysis.
Results: In CCM, total particle yield of Exodisc was
about 5 times higher than those of the rest three meth-
ods. Size distribution differed per sample, but the
ranges were comparable between the different isolation
methods. The total protein amount of SEC, precipita-
tion and Exodisc were similar which were 6–10 times
higher than that of UC. UC had the highest particle-to-
protein ratio followed by Exodisc. Precipitation and
SEC had low ratios. When loading 9ug of total protein
for Western blot, CD9, CD81, CD63 and Flot1 could
only be detected in UC and Exodisc samples, but not
precipitation or SEC. SP-IRIS and nFCM demonstrated
consistent purity findings. In urine, total particle yields
of Exodisc and SEC were about 4 times higher than

those of the rest two methods. The total protein
amount of precipitation was 3 times higher than
Exodisc and SEC, 10 times higher than UC. SEC had
the highest particle-to-protein ratio followed by UC
and Exodisc. Precipitation had low ratios. In plasma,
total particle yields of Exodisc and precipitation were
100 times higher than those of the rest two methods.
And so were the total protein amount. SEC had the
highest
particle-to-protein
ratio
followed
by
UC.
Exodisc and precipitation had low ratios. Western
blot, SP-IRIS and nFCM demonstrated consistent pur-
ity findings in urine and plasma. To evaluate particle
capture efficiency, we spiked a known number of den-
sity-gradient UC purified EVs to each method and the
recovery rate of UC, precipitation, Exodisc and SEC
was 8.6%, 31%, 50.1% and 42%, respectively.
Summary/Conclusion: The order of EV isolation pur-
ity in CCM is UC, Exodisc, SEC and precipitation. In
urine it’s SEC, Exodisc, UC and precipitation. And in
plasma, this order is SEC, UC, Exodisc and precipita-
tion. Exodisc and SEC have similar high isolation effi-
ciency followed by precipitation. UC has low efficiency
for EV capture.

A capillary-channelled polymer (C-CP) fibre spin-down tip approach for
the isolation and biomarker characterization of extracellular vesicles of
ovarian cancer origin
Kaylan D. Kelsey, Rhonda R. Powell, Terri F. Bruce and R. Kenneth Marcus
Clemson University, Clemson, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicle (EVs) profiling has
shown promise for disease detection through less inva-
sive sampling (liquid biopsies). Current diagnostic
tools for ovarian cancer are invasive or only semi-
informative. Thus, use of EVs could prove useful in
early disease detection. Demonstrated is a hydrophobic
interaction
chromatography
(HIC)-based
capillary-
channelled polymer (C-CP) fibre tip spin-down pro-
cess for the isolation of ovarian cancer EVs for use in
diagnostics.
Methods: Polyester C-CP fibre micropipette tips are
employed in the isolation of EVs from biological
matrices including cell culture media, urine, and
blood plasma in a spin-down solid-phase extraction
(SPE) approach. EVs were isolated from standards of
healthy urine origin and from SKOV3 cells (human
ovary adenocarcinoma). The C-CP fibre isolation
method (taking less than 5 mins and 10 μL sample
volumes) preserves the morphology and functionality
of EVs as confirmed by SEM, TEM, and confocal
fluorescence microscopy.
Results: The dynamic binding capacity of EV standards
on a 1 cm PET C-CP fibre tip was found to be ~7E11
particles (50%). The release of EVs was confirmed
using dot blot analysis for CD9, CD81, and CD63
tetraspanin proteins. Immobilized EVs were subjected
to immunolabeling to allow the positive identification
of a profile of ovarian cancer biomarker proteins
(HER2, CD24, EGFR, EPCAM, CA125).
Summary/Conclusion: This new EV isolation method
introduces a simple capture mode, allowing for direct
immuno-characterization and imaging on the fibre sur-
face. This offers a unique and cost-effective opportu-
nity for clinical analyses related to early detection and
diagnosis of ovarian cancers (and others). The long-
term goal is the creation of a rapid EV isolation and
biomarker detection platform.

Development and optimization of purification method of exosomes by
tangential flow filtration and ion-exchange chromatography approach
Tek Lamichhane, Ali Navaei, Sandeep Choudhary, Yonatan Levinson and
Senthil Ramaswamy
Cell & Gene Therapy R&D, Lonza Inc, Rockville, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exo-
somes have significant therapeutic potential, however,
translation of EV-based therapies has been slowed
down because of the biomanufacturing challenges.
The isolation of EVs, especially exosomes, is inherently
challenging due to their small size, and heterogeneity
in the mixture. The current isolation methods either
have low recovery rate, aggregation, damaging the
structure, time consuming or co-precipitation of con-
taminants. Specially, it is difficult to process larger
sized samples by centrifugation-based or immunoaffi-
nity based methods because of the time and cost asso-
ciated with these methods.
Methods: To overcome these roadblocks, we developed
and optimized alternative purification techniques to
isolate EVs with higher purity and yield by using tan-
gential flow filtration (TFF) coupled with ion-exchange
chromatography. We used bioreactor platform to pro-
duce EVs from serum-free medium using BM-MSC
and HEK293 s cells. BM-MSCs were cultured on

stirred tank bioreactors using microcarriers which pro-
vide a high surface area to volume ratio for the optimal
cell growth and EVs production. Impellers were used
to enhance mixing and maintain homogeneous culture
conditions that can be easily monitored and controlled.
Results: Depth filtration was applied for clarification of
conditioned medium. We screened different types of
filters during depth filtration for the best recovery of
EVs. TFF membranes with different pore sizes were
used to optimize the purity and yield of EVs. Because
of the negatively charged nature of EVs, anion
exchange chromatography was chosen to capture and
separate TFF purified vesicles by their surface charge
characteristics. We compared monolith based and
membrane-based anion exchange columns to remove
contaminants and purify exosomal fractions. The pur-
ity, size and presence of exosomal markers in isolated
EVs at each step of purification was evaluated by F-
NTA, nano-FCM and tetraspanins based ELISA kits.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, our optimized
methods improved the speed of isolation and purity
of EVs to the clinical grade. The production and isola-
tion methods of exosomes that we developed here will
be easily expandable to support large-scale and cGMP
compatible bio-manufacturing in the future.

Use of an alternating current electrokinetic microelectrode chip to posi-
tively identify oncology, neurology, and infectious disease samples
through plasma extracellular vesicle analysis
Juan Pablo Hinestrosa, Jean Lewis, David Searson, Orlando Perrera, Alfred
Kinana, Heath Balcer and Rajaram Krishnan
Biological Dynamics, Inc., San Diego, USA
Introduction: Cancer, neurological, and infectious dis-
eases are leading causes of death, with early detection
needed to improve outcomes. Extracellular vesicles
(EVs) in the blood contain disease biomarkers, but
current methods do not allow rapid analysis, and are
often limited to one biomarker type.
Methods: We developed methods using alternating cur-
rent electrokinetics (ACE) to isolate EVs from blood-
based samples and analyse the EVs in situ with down-
stream assays for protein and nucleic acid biomarkers.
We investigated if we could identify tuberculosis (TB)
donor samples, protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in
EVs derived from cancer cell lines, and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) protein biomarker levels.
Results: EV isolation was confirmed by positive iden-
tification of the proteins CD9, CD63, and CD81 and
measurement of EV mRNAs using a direct RT-ddPCR
assay. Different disease models were analysed following
method development.
TB was used as a model for infectious disease,
with 20 TB positive and 20 TB negative samples
isolated on ACE chips and analysed for levels of
lipoarabinomannan
and
Ag85.
Using
a
cut-off
above the negatives, the AUC of ROC curves were
0.9975 and 1.0, respectively.
For oncology, cancer cell lines were cultured and
EVs isolated from supernatants were spiked into
human plasma for analysis. Levels of PD-L1 or
Glypican-1 on EVs were able to be measured follow-
ing ACE capture. Additionally, DNA and RNA
mutations known to be present in the cell lines
were able to be detected using NGS and qRT-PCR,
respectively.
Using AD samples as a neurological disease model,
Tau and phospho-tau T181 (p-tau T181) in human
donor plasma were detected. In 8 AD and 5 healthy
donor samples, p-tau T181 signal increased 134% in
diseased versus healthy donors.
Summary/Conclusion: ACE chips are an innovative
EV isolation and analysis platform that allow rapid
disease sample detection in a wide range of studies
with high sensitivity and specificity.

Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the
most frequent causes of cancer-related death. In the
majority of CRC patients, mutation in the Apc gene is
among the first genetic events. It leads to uncontrolled
activation of the Wnt pathway, and thus, to adenoma
formation. Some of these adenomas may then further
progress to CRC with the accumulation of other muta-
tions. The 3D organoids maintain the cellular and
genetic heterogeneity of in vivo tissues and haves proved
to be so far the best ex vivo model of human cancers.
Here
we
analysed
the
EV-based
communication
between cancer cells and fibroblasts by i) identifying
factors that substantially increase EV release from intest-
inal cancer cells and ii) by determining cargo compo-
nents of EVs that enhance tumour cell proliferation.
Methods: We used commercially available and patient-
derived fibroblasts and CRC organoids. The Medical
Research Council of Hungary approved all experiments
with human samples and informed consent was
obtained from patients. EVs were studied by using
antibody-coated
beads,
TRPS,
NTA,
TEM
and
Western-blotting. We introduced Apc mutation into
wild
type
murine
small
intestinal
organoids
by
CRISPR-Cas9.
Results: We found that in CRC patient-derived orga-
noid cultures, small EVs were preferentially secreted.
We observed that Apc mutation and the accumulation
of the extracellular matrix component collagen criti-
cally enhanced EV secretion in intestinal organoids.
Furthermore, we showed that amphiregulin, present
on fibroblast-derived EV, contributed to the mainte-
nance of the intestinal stem cell pool and to cell pro-
liferation in epidermal growth factor-dependent CRC
organoids.
Summary/Conclusion: By proving the key role of
mutations, collagen deposition and EV-bound amphir-
egulin in the release intensity and functions of the EVs,
we identified novel mechanisms in the progression
if CRC.

fibroblasts, at the primary tumour site, promoting
angiogenesis and enhancing the migration and inva-
sion of PC cells in vitro and tumour growth in vivo.
The bone marrow is the initial site of entry into the
bone microenvironment for disseminating tumour cells
(DTCs) and is a rich source of nutrients that houses
various cells types including bone marrow derived
mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and immune cells
such as neutrophils, which have been implicated in
metastasis. Here we investigate the role of LO in repro-
gramming BM-MSCs and driving bone metastasis
in PC.
Methods: Differential centrifugation, density gradient
centrifugation, TRPS, RNA sequencing, qPCR, migra-
tion assay, invasion assay, chemotaxis assay.
Results: We report that PC-derived EVs induce distinct
gene expressions changes in BM-MSCs. RNA-Seq ana-
lysis identified inflammatory and immune regulating
cytokines as top differentially expressed genes (DEG)
in BM–MSC. Moreover, LO induced a more potent
response in BM-MSC in comparison to Exo and to
non-treated controls. The genes enriched in LO treated
BM-MSC were associated with tumour cell motility. In
agreement with the gene expression data, LO-treated
BM-MSC attracted migration and invasion of signifi-
cantly more PC cells than Exo -treated BM-MSCs. In
addition, the top DEG expressed in EV treated BM-
MSC were identified as potent neutrophil chemoattrac-
tant proteins. In line with the RNAseq findings, the LO-
treated BM-MSC demonstrated enhanced chemotaxis of
neutrophils towards them in comparison with Exo or
vehicle-treated BM-MSC. Finally, we show that the
observed differences in BM-MSC’s response to LO and
Exo may be mediated by distinct molecular pathways.
Summary/Conclusion: The results from this study
provide novel insight into how tumour derived EVs
alter the bone marrow microenvironment and how
they may drive bone metastasis in prostate cancer.

Introduction: Prostate cancer (PrCa) cells crosstalk
with the tumour microenvironment by releasing small
extracellular vesicles (sEVs). sEVs isolated from PrCa
cell media, express the epithelial-specific αvβ6 integrin,
a surface receptor for fibronectin and vitronectin. The
αvβ6 integrin is not detectable in healthy prostate tis-
sues but is highly expressed in PrCa. In this study, we
hypothesized that αvβ6 in cancer sEVs plays a crucial
role in angiogenesis.
Methods: The sEVs isolated from PrCa cell media were
characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, iodixanol
density gradients and expression of sEV markers. The
αvβ6-negative endothelial cells (HMEC1) were incubated
with αvβ6-positive sEVs from PrCa cells to evaluate the
transfer of αvβ6 by immunoblotting (IB) and FACS. The
effect of αvβ6-positive sEVs on motility, tube formation
and angiogenic signalling were assessed by Boyden cham-
ber, angiogenesis assays and IB in HMEC1.
Results: We demonstrate for the first time that the αvβ6
is de novo expressed on endothelial cell surface by sEV-
mediated protein transfer. PrCa cell-derived αvβ6-posi-
tive sEVs, significantly promote the motility and the
formation of nodes, junctions and tubules by HMEC1.
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HMEC1 treatment
with sEVs from PC3 cells that endogenously express
αvβ6, decreases pSTAT1(Y701), a negative regulator of
angiogenesis, while upregulating survivin, an inducer of
angiogenesis. HMEC1 treatment with sEVs isolated
from PC3
cells harbouring
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
downregulation of β6, or shRNA-mediated downregula-
tion of β6, results in increased levels of pSTAT1(Y701).
This sEV treatment also results in a decrease of survivin
in sEVs and HMEC1.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, our findings show that
αvβ6 in prostate cancer sEVs regulates a novel pro-
angiogenic signalling pathway.

Introduction: Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is asso-
ciated with elevated cholesterol levels; however, the
mechanisms underlying this association are not well
understood. Further, the development of bone metas-
tases is one of the most lethal processes in PCa, and is
also associated with elevated cholesterol. Interestingly,
recent work has demonstrated that exosome-mediated
intercellular communication is dependent upon choles-
terol levels in the target cell population. Here, we
investigated whether PCa exosomes promote pre-meta-
static niche formation and bone metastasis via inter-
cellular communication with bone marrow-resident
myeloid cells in a cholesterol-dependent fashion.
Methods:
Exosomes
from
enzalutamide
resistant
(EnzR) PCa cells (CWR-R1) and normal prostate
epithelial cells (PNT2) were isolated via ultracentrifu-
gation, while exosomes from patient serum samples
were
isolated
using
ExoQuick
Ultra
(System
Biosciences).
Intracardiac
injection
of
luciferase-
expressing EnzR CWR-R1 cells into C.B.-17 SCID
mice was used as a bone metastatic PCa mouse
model, and tumour burden was monitored by BLI.
Alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition
were determined via immunohistochemistry and RNA
sequencing. Sequencing of small RNAs was performed
on exosomal RNA samples obtained from conditioned
media and patient serum. A nanoparticle mimic of
high-density lipoprotein was used for targeted reduc-
tion of myeloid cell cholesterol.
Results: Data revealed that educating mice with PCa
exosomes altered the composition of the bone marrow
ECM in a pro-tumorigenic manner. Specifically, EnzR
CWR-R1 exosomes reduced thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)
expression and enhanced versican (VCAN) expression.
Both changes have been reported to occur in advanced
PCa. Furthermore, educating mice with EnzR CWR-R1
exosomes enhanced metastatic tumour burden in a
PCa mouse model. Exosome-mediated pre-metastatic
niche formation and enhanced tumour burden were
both significantly diminished by targeted reduction of
myeloid cellular cholesterol. Moreover, we found that
exosome-induced downregulation of TSP1 was specifi-
cally mediated by exosomal miR-4443. This miRNA
was also over-represented in the serum of late stage
PCa patients compared to patients with early stage
disease and healthy controls. Finally, reduced TSP1
and increased VCAN expression were also found in
bone tissues obtained from patients with bone meta-
static PCa.
Summary/Conclusion: These results offer insights into
mechanisms of PCa bone metastasis, and specifically
suggest an exosome-mediated mechanism for the link
between elevated cholesterol and advanced, bone
metastatic PCa. Finally, these results suggest that exo-
somal miR-4443 may be a viable diagnostic and ther-
apeutic target for PCa.

Introduction:
Extracellular
vesicles
(EVs)
are
secreted from cells, and carry bioactive proteins and
RNA cargoes. Increasing numbers of studies have
identified key roles for exosomes in driving aggres-
sive
tumour
behaviours,
including
metastasis.
However, the detailed mechanisms and responsible
factors in the EV cargo are still unclear. Recently,
immune system has been considered as an important
factor in establishing and maintaining metastasis.
Our goal is to identify the role of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) derived small
EVs (SEVs) in tumour metastasis from the study
analysing the effects of SEVs on metastasis and
tumour immunity.
Methods: SEVs were collected from the conditioned
media of HNSCCs and purified through cushioned
density gradient ultracentrifugation. An orthotopic
mouse model was used for the assessment of tumour
angiogenesis and metastasis. MOC1 (inflammation-
inducing rarely metastasizing murine HNSCC line)
and MOC2 (highly metastasizing murine HNSCC
line) were used for this study. MOC1 and MOC2 cells
were transplanted into mice tongues orthotopically,
and MOC1/MOC2 derived SEVs or PBS were injected
into the tumour twice in a week. Two weeks after
tumour transplantation, mice were sacrificed and
tumours were sectioned for pathological analysis and
FACS analysis. In FACS analysis, the number and
species
of
tumour-infiltrated
immune
cells
were
measured.
Results: Injection of SEVs from MOC1 into MOC2
tumours suppressed frequency of lymph node metas-
tasis. On the other hand, injection of SEVs from MOC2
into MOC1 tumours didn’t promote metastasis. CD4
positive T-cell distribution in MOC2 tumour was sig-
nificantly changed by MOC1 SEV injection. T-cell

increased the frequency of metastasis in MOC1-SEV
treated MOC2 tumours. From the result of proteomics
analysis on MOC1 and MOC2 SEVs, immune-regu-
lated proteins and metastasis-suppressing proteins
were observed in MOC1 SEVs.
Summary/Conclusion: We find that low aggressive
HNSCC SEVs affect metastasis of highly metastasized
HNSCC, and also find that changing immune cell dis-
tribution may be related to the result. This mechanism
and finding contributes to understanding the possible
role of HNSCC SEVs on metastasis as well as on the
tumour immune microenvironment.

Introduction: The cadherin Dsg2 is a stem cell marker
that is upregulated in many different cancers, including
SCCs, and its expression correlates with poor prog-
nosis. Dsg2 activates mitogenic signalling and plays a
key role in cell proliferation, migration, and survival.
We recently showed that Dsg2 enhances EV release,
but the mechanism by which these EVs modulate
tumorigenesis is not fully understood.

cient
mutant,

sion was analysed by RNAseq and confirmed by
qPCR.
Results: Dsg2 enhanced EV release by 40% and
promoted a ~ fivefold increase in tumour size in
xenograft models. Tumour growth was increased
when control cells were treated with a single 20 µg
dose of EVs. Loss of palmitoylation, which altered
membrane trafficking of Dsg2, reduced EV release
(~55%) as well as tumour development. Plasma EVs
from
xenograft
mice
reflected
in
vitro
particle
counts from SCC cell lines. A cytokine array analy-
sis was performed revealing that Dsg2-EVs were
enriched with pro-inflammatory cytokines including
IL-8, a potent chemotactic and angiogenic factor.
Most importantly, IL-8 was surface-bound on EVs.
Furthermore, RNAseq revealed miR-146a, a nega-
tive regulator of IL-8, to be significantly downregu-
lated in response to Dsg2. Treatment with miR-146a
mimic
or
miR-146a
inhibitor
decreased
or
increased, IL-8 expression in SCC cells, respectively.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, Dsg2 plays a key
role in SCC tumour development by increasing EV
biogenesis and downregulating miR-146a, which in
turn upregulates IL-8 synthesis and release which can
promote invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis.

Introduction: Stem- and progenitor cell transplanta-
tion therapy holds great promise for regenerating
damaged heart tissue. Several lines of evidence suggest
that its efficacy is mainly caused by secreted extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs). Indeed, cardiac progenitor cell
(CPC)-derived EVs have been shown to protect the
myocardium against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in
several preclinical models. However, the underlying
mechanisms for CPC-EV-mediated cardioprotection
remain elusive. Here, we utilized the proteomic com-
position of CPC-EVs released during different culture
conditions, to unravel protein-mediated effects of
CPC-EVs on the endothelium.
Methods: CPCs were stimulated with calcium ionophore
(ca ion-EVs) or vehicle (control-EVs) for 24 hours and
EVs were isolated from serum-free conditioned medium
using size exclusion chromatography. EV concentration
and size was assessed using NTA. EVs were functionally
characterized based on endothelial cell activation by wes-
tern blotting and an endothelial cell scratch assay. The
proteomic composition of both EV conditions was profiled
using mass spectrometry. CPC-EV knockouts for specific
proteins were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
Results: We found enhanced phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and AKT in endothelial cells and increased
wound closure after stimulation with control-EVs, but
not after stimulation with ca ion-EVs. Proteomic
analysis identified a total of 1411 EV-associated pro-
teins, with 79 proteins uniquely expressed in control-
EVs. Another 68 proteins were revealed as candidate
proteins, based on their relative enrichment in con-
trol-EVs compared with ca ion-EVs. GO analysis
demonstrated that differentially expressed proteins
were involved in vascular endothelial growth factor
signalling,
extracellular
matrix
organization
and
angiogenesis. To investigate the involvement of the
individual candidate proteins on endothelial cell acti-
vation, knockout EVs of multiple proteins were gen-
erated and functionally characterized.
Summary/Conclusion: A specific set of EV proteins is
identified that may be functionally responsible for the
activation of endothelial cells upon exposure to CPC-
EVs. Generating knockout EVs for each of these pro-
teins will help to investigate their individual roles.
This may lead to a better mechanistic understanding
of the use of CPC-EVs as therapeutics for cardiac
repair.

ischaemic cardiovascular disease. We have previously
shown that human CD34+ cell-derived exosomes
(CD34Exo) improve perfusion and function of the
ischaemic tissues. Hypoxia is shown to modulate the
secretion and content of exosomes in both cardiovas-
cular and cancer research. Therefore, we hypothesized
that hypoxia can modulate the content and regenera-
tive efficacy of human CD34Exo.
Methods: CD34Exo were isolated from primary
human CD34+ stem cells cultured under hypoxia
(1.5% O2, H-CD34Exo) or normoxia (20% O2, N-
CD34Exo) using density gradient ultracentrifuga-
tion. CD34Exo size was measured using TRPS,
NTA, and DLS and surface protein expression was
determined using imaging flow cytometry. Function
of CD34Exo was assessed using cell viability, migra-
tion and Matrigel tube formation assays in vitro and
a mouse hind limb ischaemia model (HLI) in vivo.
Protein content of hypoxic or normoxic CD34Exo
was evaluated via LC-MS/MS and 2-D -DIGE fol-
lowed by LC-MS/MS.
Results: We did not observe any significant differ-
ences in size or in quantity of exosomes secreted
from H- or N-CD34 cells. Both H- and N-CD34Exo
expressed CD9, CD81 and CD63 surface markers.
Interestingly,
H-CD34Exo
significantly
improved
cell
viability,
migration
and
tube
formation
of
HUVECs in vitro compared to N-CD34Exo. In the
same line, H-CD34Exo also significantly improved
perfusion (ratio: 0.93 ± 0.05 v 0.77 ± 0.02) and pre-
vented ischaemic limb amputation (0% v 37.5%) as
compared to N-Exo (p < 0.05; n = 7–8) in a murine
(BalbC nude) model of hind limb ischaemia. Flow
cytometry and confocal microscopy indicated that
H-Exo was uptaken by endothelial cells in the ischae-
mic limb. Remarkably, we detected several proteins
(including a fragment of hemopexin) and miRNAs
(mir-210) that could be responsible for the proangio-
genic and beneficial function of H-CD34Exo. We
have also demonstrated that removal of surface pro-
teins diminished the pro-angiogenic function of
CD34Exo.
Summary/Conclusion: Hypoxia enhanced the proan-
giogenic and regenerative potential of CD34Exo, and
thus, may represent a more efficient clinical strategy for
CD34Exo therapy. Our research is clinically important
to improve therapeutic angiogenesis in diabetic and
cardiovascular patients with compromised stem cell
populations.

MiRNA-192 and −432 depleted c-kit+ progenitor cell exosomes promotes
the proliferation, migration of mesenchymal stem cells and regulates
inflammation
Hyun-Ji Parka, Jessica R. Hoffmanb and Michael Davisb
aEmory University, Decatur, USA; bEmory University, Atlanta, USA
Introduction: Exosomes, a subset of membrane nano-
vesicles, transfer cellular information by passing proteins
and nucleic acids between cells. Exosomes have been
implicated as the mechanistic unit in stem cell therapy,
as inhibition of exosome synthesis abrogates the effects
of cell therapy following cardiac injury. More impor-
tantly,
increasing
evidence
indicates that
miRNAs
(miRs) within exosomes serve as important signalling
molecules to regulate inflammation, recruit stem cells,
and repair diseased tissue. Among exosomal miRs, miR-
192 and −432 are known to decrease angiogenesis, cell
migration, and increase inflammation in various types of
cells. Here, we investigated the inhibition of these nega-
tive miRs as a means to improve the reparative capacity
of c-kit+ progenitor cell (CPCs) exosomes.
Methods: CPCs were isolated from three paediatric
patients using magnetic-bead sorting. 2ʹ-O-methylated
RNA duplexes inhibited miR-192 and −432 expressions
in CPCs. Exosomes (inhExos) were isolated from miR-
inhibited CPC conditioned medium. MiR expression in
exosomes and CPC was quantified by qRT-PCR.
Migration and proliferation of mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) were assessed two days post-exosome
treatment. For inflammation analysis, THP1 cells
with/without TNFα exposure were treated with exo-
somes and the expression of IL-6, −8, and −10 was
quantified by qRT-PCR. Finally, the angiogenic poten-
tial of inhExos was tested by tube formation of cardiac
endothelial cells.
Results: Inhibitor treatment of CPCs decreased exosomal
miR-192 and −432 expression. Treatment with inhExos
enhanced MSC migration and proliferation compared
with normal CPC exosome (norExo). Moreover, inhExos
showed promising results for immune regulation, as
TNFα-induced inflammation was decreased in THP1
exposed to inhExos for 4 h. However, tube formation
capacity is slightly decreased (~20%) by inhExo compared
to norExo.
Summary/Conclusion: Exosomes from miR-192 and
−432-depleted CPCs may be a promising strategy for

Endo-lysosomes as an alternative intracellular location for EV cargo
delivery with disease relevance

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are lipid-
bilayer nanovesicles that carry macromolecules and
act as paracrine vectors for cell-to-cell communication.
The processes regulating EV biogenesis are largely
known, whereas how EV cargo is delivered to recipient
cells remains poorly understood. A simple mechanism
proposed is direct EV fusion with the cell membrane
that liberate cargo into the cytosol. In this study, we
observed that cargo release occurs also at an alternative
intracellular location and that this acquires a disease
relevance.
Methods: EV were isolated by serial centrifugation and
characterized. For uptake studies, EV were traced by
labelling donor cells with a lipophilic dye or by over-
expressing GFP-CD63. Uptake was assessed by cyto-
fluorimetry or by live confocal imaging. Co-localization
studies were performed with ectopic marker expression
or by immune staining. Protein-protein interaction was
analysed by bi-molecular fluorescence complementa-
tion (BiFC). Prion-like transmission was studied using
a pro-fibrillogenic Tau fragment in donor cells and
full-length Tau in recipient cells. For quantification of
subcellular localization, an automated algorithm based
on machine learning was developed. Lysosomal stress
was monitored by nuclear translocation of TFE3 and
lysotracker staining. Antibodies directed against patho-
genic epitopes of Tau were employed to assess prion-
like transmission.
Results: EV were taken up by recipient cells through an
endocytic process and accumulated in endo-lysosomes
(EL). When cells were exposed to EV carrying a pro-
fibrillogenic Tau, recipient cells accumulated Tau
within EL by an autophagic process. Direct interaction
of EV-Tau and cellular Tau in EL favoured the
appearance of pathological epitopes. Cells displaying
this condition showed an increased EL stress and
cytotoxicity.
Summary/Conclusion: In this study, for the first time
we report that EL represent a critical subcellular loca-
tion
where
transcellular
prion-like
transmission
mediated by EV of a neurodegeneration-associated
protein occurs. Thus, the degradative pathway most
likely involved in the recycle of EV and endogenous
proteins is highjacked in disease. These findings repre-
sent a novel mechanism for EV acting as vector for
transcellular propagation of Tau, which opens up new
therapeutic interventions trying to halt the disease.

Introduction: Interfering with the mechanisms regulating
intercellular communication mediated by extracellular
membrane vesicles (EVs) may find relevance especially
in oncology where cancer cell-derived EVs have an impli-
cation in the malignant transformation of tumour micro-
environment. Our laboratories recently demonstrated a
novel intracellular pathway in which a fraction of endo-
cytosed EV-associated proteins is transported into the
nucleoplasm of the host cell via a subpopulation of
Rab7+ late endosomes entering into the nucleoplasmic
reticulum. Here, we have investigated the effect of a
monovalent Fab antibody against the tetraspanin CD9
(referred hereafter as CD9 Fab), on the internalization
of EVs and nuclear transfer of their cargo proteins.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Methods: To monitor the intracellular transport of
EV-associated proteins, we used bioengineered fluor-
escent EVs containing CD9-GFP fusion protein from
FEMX-I melanoma, SW480 colorectal cancer and
bone
marrow-derived
mesenchymal
stromal
cells
(MSC) as donors and the same cell types as recipients.
EVs were enriched by differential centrifugation from
72 h serum-free conditioned media and characterized
by ZetaView nanoparticle tracking analysis, zeta-
potential and immunoblotting. CD9 Fab was prepared
from 5H9 hybridoma cells using the Pierce Fab pur-
ification kit.
Results: We previously demonstrated that silencing
CD9
both
in
EVs
and
recipient
cells
strongly
decreased the endocytosis of EVs and abolished the
nuclear transfer of their cargos. Here we show that
CD9 Fab significantly reduced the cellular uptake of
CD9-GFP+ EVs and the nuclear transfer of their
proteins in melanoma, colorectal cancer and MSC
used as receptor cells in a dose-dependent manner.
The effect on the nuclear transfer is probably a direct
consequence of the endocytosis inhibition of EVs. In
contrast, the divalent, intact CD9 antibody stimulated
both events.
Summary/Conclusion: The effect of CD9 Fab appears
independent of the used EV-donor cell types or recep-
tor cells, probably due to the widespread expression of
CD9 both at plasma membrane and EV surface. In
conclusion, by impeding intercellular communication
in the tumour microenvironment, CD9 Fab-mediated
inhibition of EV uptake, combined with direct target-
ing of cancerous cells could lead to the development of
novel anti-cancer therapeutic strategies.

Introduction: Live imaging of exosomes is one of the
required tools to understand the function of exosomes.
Our previous live-cell reporter, pHluorin-CD63 allows
dynamic subcellular monitoring of exosome secretion
in migrating and spreading cells. However, there were
some caveats to its use, including dim fluorescence and
the inability to make cell lines that stably express the
protein.
Methods: A stabilizing mutation, M153 R is incorpo-
rated in the pHluorin moiety and now exhibits stable
expression in cells and superior monitoring of exosome
secretion. A dual-tag reporter was created by incorpor-
ating a further pH-insensitive red fluorescent protein,
mScarlet to the C-terminus of pHluo_M153 R-CD63.
Cancer cells stably expressing the constructs were
imaged using a variety of microscopy techniques in
vitro as well as in vivo. Purified small EVs labelled
with pHuo_M153 R-CD63 were imaged using immu-
nogold transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
quantitated for the half-life in the blood circulation
using flow cytometry.
Results: pHluo_M153 R-CD63 and pHluo_M153 R-
CD63-mScarlet are exclusively detected in exosome-
enrich small EV preparations. Immunogold TEM
visualizes the pHluo_M153 R tag is located on the
surface
of
small
EVs.
Live
cell
imaging
reveals
pHluo_M153 R-CD63–positive puncta
left behind
migrating cells suggesting the deposition consists of
exosomes. Those puncta and trails are not only positive
for exosome markers such as CD63, Alix, and TSG101
but also correspond to small EVs observed by a scan-
ning electron microscopy. The dual-tag reporter allows
visualization of the exosome lifecycle, including multi-
vesicular body (MVB) trafficking, MVB fusion, exo-
some uptake and endosome acidification.
Summary/Conclusion: Using pHluo_M153 R-CD63
construct, we demonstrate superior visualization of
exosome secretion in multiple contexts and a role of
exosomes in promoting leader-follower behaviour in
collective migration by observing that exosomes are
secreted at the front of migrating cells and left behind
in exosome trails. The dual-tag reporter allows visuali-
zation of the entire exosome lifecycle. We anticipate
that these reporters will be broadly useful to investigate
regulation and functions of exosome secretion and
uptake in diverse physiological conditions.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a pivo-
tal role in intercellular communication through func-
tional transfer of bioactive cargo, including RNA
molecules. Despite increasing interest in EV-mediated
RNA transfer, our understanding of the pathways and
mechanisms regulating EV-mediated RNA delivery
and processing is limited due to a lack of suitable
readout systems. We recently developed a novel
CRISPR/Cas9-based reporter system that allows study
of EV-mediated RNA transfer at single-cell resolution.
Here, we further validate this system by studying the
role of known targets involved in EV uptake and intra-
cellular
membrane
trafficking,
and
subsequently
employ this system to uncover various novel genes
that play a regulatory role in functional RNA transfer.
Methods: We employed a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based
stoplight reporter system, in which eGFP expression is
activated upon functional delivery of targeting single
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) stably expressed by donor cells.
Intercellular functional RNA transfer was assessed by
measuring eGFP expression in acceptor cells using
fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry after
direct co-culture, transwell co-culture, and upon addi-
tion of isolated EVs. Potential roles of various genes in
intercellular RNA transfer were assessed by RNAi-
mediated target knockdown in acceptor cells, prior to
co-culture experiments. RNAi knockdown was con-
firmed by qPCR analysis.
Results: A significant activation of eGFP expression
was observed in acceptor cells after direct co-culture
and transwell co-culture with donor cells expressing
sgRNAs, as well as after addition of EVs from cells
expressing sgRNAs. Reporter activation was substan-
tially decreased after knockdown of multiple targets
involved in EV uptake through endocytosis and/or
intracellular membrane trafficking. Based on these
results, a potential role of various novel genes in inter-
cellular RNA transfer was studied in acceptor cells.
These experiments uncovered various novel targets
involved in ECM binding, endocytosis, intracellular
membrane trafficking, as well as various Rho GTPase
interactors.
Summary/Conclusion: We previously demonstrated a
CRISPR/Cas9-based reporter system that allows the
study of functional delivery of small non-coding
RNAs with single-cell resolution. Here, we show that
this novel approach allows the study of specific genetic
targets and pathways in EV-mediated functional RNA
delivery, and unravel the regulatory pathways that dic-
tate the underlying processes.

Introduction: Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), including
exosomes, are thought to mediate intercellular commu-
nication through the transfer of biomolecules from
donor to acceptor cells. Occurrence of EV-content
delivery within acceptor cells has not been unambigu-
ously demonstrated, let alone quantified, and remains
debated.
Methods: We developed a cell-based assay in which
EVs containing luciferase-tagged cytosolic cargo are
loaded on unlabelled acceptor cells. Measurement of
luciferase
activity
associated
with
acceptor
cells
revealed EV uptake efficacy. Additional cell fractiona-
tion procedure that separates membranes from cytosol
revealed the occurrence of EV-content release within
the cytosol of acceptor cells.
Results: Results from dose-responses, kinetics, and
temperature-block experiments suggest that EV-uptake
is limited (1% spontaneous rate at 1h), does not depend
on bona-fide EV-receptor, at least for the tested accep-
tor HeLa cells. Yet, further characterization of this
limited EV-uptake, through cell fractionation that
separates membranes from cytosol, revealed the occur-
rence of EV-content release within the cytosol of
acceptor
cells.
Cytosolic
release
is
inhibited
by
Bafilomycin-A and overexpression of IFITM proteins,
which prevent virus content delivery.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results show that EV-con-
tent release requires endosomal acidification and sug-
gest the involvement of membrane fusion.

Introduction: Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain
tumour with a poor prognosis. Its ability to develop
therapeutic resistance result in devastating clinical out-
comes. To solve the intractable problem, we need
highly sensitive diagnostics that can detect the mole-
cular changes during treatments. Extracellular vesicles
(EVs) can be a potential biomarker to monitor treat-
ments and the host cell EV mapping can better reflect
molecular changes in the tumour immune microenvir-
onment. We have developed a droplet-based single EV
protein sequencing platform that overcomes limita-
tions
of
current
bulk
measurement
technologies,
which make it difficult to discover a rare EV popula-
tion in the presence of high background.
Methods: We multiplex protein measurements to pro-
file hundreds of proteins at a time by using an anti-
body-DNA conjugate and sequencing. We barcode
each EV in droplets and make amplicons that are
comprised of both EV barcodes and antibody bar-
codes for sequencing. Barcoded antibodies are made
using TCO-tetrazine click reaction and EVs are
labelled with these barcoded antibodies. The labelled
EVs are encapsulated into droplets with barcoded
beads that serve as a template for EV barcodes. We
then perform extension to make amplicons that con-
tain both EV barcodes and antibody barcodes for
sequencing.
Results: We successfully fabricated barcoded beads
using a split-pool approach and validated by observing
a fluorescence decrease of the SYBR Green after DNA
strand denaturation. We used a 3-channel droplet
maker to encapsulate barcoded beads, single EV, and
master mix into droplets. Close packing of barcoded
beads allowed >95% encapsulation into droplets. Both
droplet and tube-based methods achieved a similar
high amplification efficiency (Ct < 30 for 300 EVs).
We confirmed the amplicon size by running a gel,
which showed the right amplicon size (~150 bp) from
the droplet and tube prepared samples and no signal
from the negative control.
Summary/Conclusion: The droplet-based single EV
profiling platform has the ability to identify rare
immune EV subtypes in the peripheral blood, which
would otherwise be impossible to detect due to the co-
presence of abundant normal EVs. This cutting-edge
technique has the potential to revolutionize treatment
monitoring of high-cost immunotherapies, avoid unne-
cessary toxicities, and enhance personalized medicine
capabilities.

Introduction: Single-molecule localization microscopy
(SMLM) can detect individual biomolecules with nanos-
cale precision. Although the technique has been routinely
used to quantify biomolecules in cells, several technical
challenges have impeded a similarly robust quantification
in extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by cells. To address
this, we developed optimized analytical protocol followed

by quantitative SMLM to robustly assess EVs derived
from either cultured cells or patient biofluids.
Methods: Size exclusion chromatography was used to
isolate EVs. EV membranes were labelled with various
fluorescent reagents; core beads or size exclusion col-
umns efficiently separated excess fluorescent molecules
from labelled EVs. While imaging conditions needed to
be significantly optimized when EVs were detected
with fluorescent lipophilic membrane dyes, EVs were
easily detected with lectins conjugated to fluorescent
dyes typically used for SMLM. To ensure that the
SMLM imaging data was robustly quantified, we opti-
mized our analysis algorithms.
Results: We used our methodology to assess EVs iso-
lated from plasma of patients with pancreatic cancer.
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and
the study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board. We determined the number of isolated EVs,
their size, and the abundance of several biomarkers.
According to our results, patients with pancreatic can-
cer exhibited a unique population of larger EVs con-

Summary/Conclusion: The methodological advance-
ment in analytical preparation, SMLM imaging, and

new diagnostic paradigm, our ultimate goal is to
advance single molecule characterization of EVs for
precision medicine.

Introduction: In this study, we compared four ortho-
gonal technologies for sizing, counting, and phenotyp-
ing
of
EVs.
The
platforms
were:
single-particle
interferometric reflectance imaging senor (SP-IRIS)
with optional fluorescence, nanoFCM nanoflow (NF),
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with fluores-
cence,
and
microfluidic
resistive
pulse
sensing
(MRPS). Results from these platforms were compared
with results from standard EV characterization techni-
ques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and western blot (WB).
Methods: Human T lymphocyte H9 (high CD81, low
CD63) and promonocytic U937 (low CD81, high
CD63) cells were chosen for their distinct tetraspanin
profiles without abnormalities that might result from
genetic manipulation. EVs were isolated from culture
conditioned medium (CCM) by differential ultracen-
trifugation (dUC) and size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) and characterized per MISEV2018 guidelines.
Synthetic particles (silica and polystyrene spheres)
with known concentrations and mixed size distribu-
tions were also tested.
Results: Particle counts from NF and MRPS were consis-
tent, while NTA detected approximately one order of
magnitude lower for CCM derived EVs, but not for syn-
thetic particles. SP-IRIS events could not be used to esti-
mate particle concentrations. For sizing, NF, MRPS, and
SP-IRIS returned similar size profiles, with smaller sizes
predominating (per power law distribution), but with sen-
sitivity typically dropping off below diameters of 60 nm.
NTA detected a population of particles with a mode dia-
meter above 100 nm. Additionally, SP-IRIS, NF, and
MRPS were able to identify at least three of four distinct
size populations in a mixture of silica or polystyrene nano-
particles. Finally, for tetraspanin phenotyping, the SP-IRIS
platform in fluorescence mode and NF were able to detect
at least two markers on the same particle.
Summary/Conclusion: Based on the results of the
study, we can draw conclusions about existing single-
particle analysis capabilities that may be useful for EV
biomarker development and mechanistic studies.

importance to EV organotropism. Yet, most techniques
rely on bulk characterization, or are severely restricted
by the diffraction limit. The ExoView R100 (NanoView
Biosciences) combines interferometry, immunocapture,
and immunofluorescence, introduced as an alternative
technique to multiplex protein detection on single EVs
below the limit of diffraction. Here, we use this tech-
nique to characterize tetraspanin multiplexing on EVs
and to identify spatial patterning of tetraspanins using
steric hindrance of antibodies (Abs).
Methods: EVs were isolated from conditioned media
from SKOV-3 cell culture or human serum. EVs were
incubated overnight on chips to allow immunocapture by
anti-CD9, anti-CD63, or anti-CD81. Chips were then
incubated with three fluorescent Abs against the same
epitopes and imaged on the ExoView R100. Following
concentration optimization, EVs were tested after pre-
incubating with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimi-
dyl ester (CFSE) or fluorescent Abs against tetraspanins.
Results: Using different concentrations of EVs, binding
curves could be fit to characterize binding kinetics of Abs.
Maximum concentration of EVs could be identified that
minimized fluorescent overlap. Bright-field interferome-
try (detection limit ~ 50 nm) distinguished 10x fewer
bound EVs than fluorescent detection, while pre-labelling
EVs with CFSE produced 10x more detectable EVs than
immunofluorescence. Interestingly, EVs captured by one
tetraspanin did not necessarily show high fluorescent
detection of the same tetraspanin. Upon pre-incubating
EVs with a single Ab, vastly different expression profiles
were identified, indicating significant steric hindrance
between Abs. Furthermore, pre-incubating EVs with
anti-CD9 Ab significantly decreased detection of CD81
with less impact on CD63. This discrepancy indicated
possible spatial patterning of tetraspanins with CD9 and
CD81 closely colocalizing on the EV surface.
Summary/Conclusion: This combination of interfero-
metry, immunocapture, and immunofluorescence pro-
duces unique information about size distribution of EVs
and single EV protein profile. This data corroborates that
EVs have distinct subpopulations of tetraspanins and
indicates that tetraspanins may be spatially patterned.

Regulation of liver homoeostasis, regeneration and diseases by mesench-
ymal stem cell-derived apoptotic extracellular vesicles
Bingdong Sui
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA
Introduction: Billions of cells undergo apoptosis and
produce apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApopEVs)
each day, whereas the roles of ApopEVs in regulating
the organismal health and disease remain poorly
understood. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) emerge
as critical contributors to tissue homoeostasis, while
MSCs suffer from apoptosis in regenerative transplan-
tation. In this study, we investigated the function and
mechanisms of MSC-derived ApopEVs in regulating
the organismal homoeostasis.
Methods: Fas mutant (Fasmut) and Caspase 3 knock-
out (Casp3-/-) mice were applied for apoptotic and
ApopEV deficiency. Mouse bone marrow MSCs were
cultured and apoptosis was induced by Staurosporine
(STS). MSC-derived ApopEVs were collected by serial
centrifuges and were infused into mouse circulation via
caudal vein. Tracing of ApopEVs were performed by
radioisotope or fluorescent labelling. Liver homoeosta-
sis was evaluated at the histological and functional
aspects. Liver regeneration was induced by partial
hepatectomy
(PHx).
Acetaminophen
(APAP)
was
used to establish acute liver drug injury. High-fat diet
(HFD) was used to establish type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Results:
After
systemic
injection,
MSC-derived
ApopEVs migrate to liver and can be uptaken by liver
macrophages and hepatocytes. Fasmut and Casp3-/-
mice develop hepatomegaly with structural disorders,
which particularly reveals hepatocyte polyploidization.
Furthermore, Fasmut and Casp3-/- mice demonstrate
liver
glucose
and
lipid
metabolic
disorders.
Importantly, MSC-derived ApopEV infusion signifi-
cantly rescues structural and metabolic dysfunction in
Fasmut and Casp3-/- mice. Mechanistically, ApopEVs
use the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion pro-
tein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein for
interactions with recipient organelles thus transferring
signalling molecules. Moreover, MSC-derived ApopEV
infusion promotes liver regeneration after PHx, pre-
vents APAP-induced liver injury, and ameliorates
NAFLD in T2D.
Summary/Conclusion: MSC-derived ApopEVs serve
as crucial regulators of liver homoeostasis, regeneration
and diseases. These findings indicate potential signifi-
cant roles of ApopEVs in maintaining the organismal
health and in developing therapeutics for diseases.

(MSC-sEVs) mediate osteochondral regeneration in
rats. However, the therapeutic effects of these MSC-
sEVs/exosomes in restoring the mechanical compe-
tence of the repaired cartilage for joint function in a
clinically
relevant

model
remain
to
be
addressed. To investigate this, we compared the struc-
tural and mechanical properties of the repaired carti-
lage
in
a
rabbit
model
after
intraarticular
administration of MSC-sEVs and hyaluronic acid
(HA) with that of HA alone, which is widely used as
visco-supplementation.
Methods: Bilateral osteochondral defects were surgi-
cally created on 17 rabbits. Immediately after surgery
and at days 7 and 14 post-surgery, 9 rabbits received 1-
ml injections of 200 µg MSC-sEVs and HA in both
knees, and 8 rabbits received 1-ml injections of HA in
both knees. At 6 and 12 weeks, macroscopic evaluation,
histological scoring and compressive testing at different
points on the repaired cartilage were performed.
Results: Defects treated with MSC-sEV/HA showed
improvements with time in macroscopic and histologi-
cal scores and mechanical properties than defects trea-
ted with HA alone. In contrast, HA treated defects
showed some repair at 6 weeks, but this was not sus-
tained, as evidenced by significant deterioration of
histological scores and a plateau in mechanical proper-
ties from 6 to 12 weeks. By 12 weeks, the MSC-sEV/HA
repaired
tissues
demonstrated
significantly
better
macroscopic score (10.33 vs 7.5; P < 0.001) and histo-
logical score (21.87 vs 11.11; P < 0.001). Mechanical
strength as measured by the Young’s modulus was
significantly higher in the MSC-sEV/HA repaired car-
tilage than that in HA repaired tissues [defect centre
(13.41 vs 3.95MPa; P = 0.001) and overall periphery
(12.22 vs 3.37MPa; P = 0.012], and approximated that
of the adjacent native cartilage.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
findings
demonstrated
that MSC-sEVs and HA not only improved tissue
morphology of the repaired cartilage but also promoted
functional mechanical competence. This study estab-
lishes a clinically translatable protocol for use of MSC-
sEVs for cartilage repair.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC)-
exosome (MEx) treatment has shown considerable pro-
mise in experimental models of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH).
Mechanisms by which MEx afford their beneficial
effects remain incompletely understood and here, we
embark into investigating them through assessment of
MEx biodistribution and impact on immune cell
heterogeneity.
Methods: Newborn FVB mice were exposed to hyper-
oxia (HYRX, 75% O2) at birth and returned to room
air at postnatal day (PN) 14. Mice received a bolus
MEx dose at PN4. Adoptive transfer studies were
used to determine the role of MEx-educated myeloid
cells in vivo. Mice were harvested at PN4, 7, 14, or 28
to characterize MEx biodistribution and for assessment
of pulmonary parameters.
Results: MEx therapy effectively ameliorated core features
of HYRX-induced neonatal lung injury, improving alveo-
lar simplification, pulmonary fibrosis, vascular remodel-
ling and blood vessel loss. Exercise capacity testing and
assessment of PH showed functional improvements fol-
lowing MEx therapy. Biodistribution studies demon-
strated that MEx localize in the lung, where they
interact with lung monocytes/macrophages. Whole lung
mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed that MEx treatment
promotes a pro-homoeostatic shift in lung immune cell
apportion, replenishing the early HYRX-induced deple-
tion in pulmonary CD45+ immune cells, restoring alveo-
lar
monocyte
and
macrophage
populations
and
suppressing cellular inflammation. Ex vivo and in vivo
analysis showed that MEx promotes a “pro-resolving”
CCR2- monocyte phenotype. Notably, adoptive transfer
of MEx-educated bone marrow-derived myeloid cells
(BMDMy), but not naïve BMDMy, restored alveolar
architecture, blunted fibrosis, improved vascular remodel-
ling and pulmonary blood vessel loss.
Summary/Conclusion:
MEx
treatment
ameliorates
core features of experimental BPD, restoring lung
architecture, decreasing pulmonary fibrosis and vascu-
lar muscularization, ameliorating PH and improving
exercise capacity. The beneficial actions of MEx are
associated with modulation of immune cell pheno-
types,
arising
from
MEx-monocyte
interaction.
Furthermore,
adoptive
transfer
of
MEx-educated
BMDMy rescued, at least in part, alveolar architecture,
reduce fibrosis, improve vascular remodelling and pul-
monary blood vessel loss.

Introduction: Vascular inflammation plays a critical
role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Despite
decades of research, there is no curative therapy for
either condition. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
shown preclinical efficacy, mediated by release of extra-
cellular vesicles. Hence, MSC-derived small extracellu-
lar vesicles (sEVs) can harness the benefits of MSCs
with advantages in cost and safety. This study aims to
evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of sEVs in
preclinical ARDS and PAH.
Methods: MSC-sEVs were characterized by nanoparti-
cle tracking analysis, electron microscopy and western
blot. Live fluorescence imaging measured in vitro and
in vivo distribution of sEVs. Using a lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced mouse model of acute lung injury
(ALI), a time course study of inflammatory response
guided endpoint analyses. Cell count and cytokines
were
measured
in
bronchoalveolar
lavage
fluid
(BALF) and histological lung injury was assessed. In
ALI mice, saline, MSCs, MSC conditioned media or
sEVs were administered 0.5 h post-LPS. Using a mono-
crotaline (MCT)-induced rat model of PAH, animals
received saline or sEVs at day 3. Haemodynamic
changes and right ventricular hypertrophy were evalu-
ated at 3 weeks.
Results: MSC-sEVs were 72 nm in size with CD63/81
expression. PKH26-labelled sEVs were taken up by
endothelial cells. In the ALI time course study, cell
count and IL1b in BALF peaked at 24h post-LPS,
whereas IL6 peaked at 10h. Histology showed signifi-
cant intra-alveolar cell infiltrate at 72h. MSC condi-
tioned media attenuated IL1b in BALF, whereas a trend
towards reductions in IL1b and cell count were seen
from delivery of MSCs and sEVs. Using fluorescence
imaging, lung accumulation of DiR-labelled sEVs was
highest when administered 1 h post-LPS as compared
to 5 h, 10 h or 24h. For PAH rats, sEVs reduced right
ventricular systolic pressure (51.4 ± 8.3 mmHg) as
compared to control (68.1 ± 0.4 mmHg; P = 0.012),
whereas no changes were observed for right ventricular
remodelling.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the
potential of MSC-sEVs to be used as a cell-free immu-
nomodulatory therapy for acute and chronic lung vas-
cular
diseases.
Additional
live
and
ex-vivo
biodistribution studies will determine optimal timing
of sEV administration, tissue distribution and clearance
in both ALI and PAH.

Introduction: Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal
Stem Cells (UCMSCs) have been shown to suppress
inflammatory responses in studies of autoimmune dis-
eases. These therapeutic effects can be attributed to
paracrine signalling, by which extracellular vesicles
(EVs) are one of the essential components. This study
looks at how the culture conditions of UCMSCs affects
the type of EVs they secrete. It also aims to identify an
EV population with an anti-inflammatory potential for
the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
Methods: UCMSCs were isolated and culture expanded
in a Quantum® cell expansion system, then grown at
21%O2, 5%O2 and primed with a pro-inflammatory
cocktail. EVs were isolated from UCMSC conditioned
media
by

proteins in the EVs.

when analysed for size and morphology. All EVs dis-
played

Introduction: Multiple studies have shown that neuro-
nal-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEs) in blood con-
tain Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers, especially
Tau. However, the convergent validity of Tau in
blood NDEs in relation to brain pathology is yet to
be determined. To address this, we measured total and
phosphorylated Tau levels in matched NDE and brain
tissue samples from AD mouse models.
Methods: We collected the cortex, hippocampus and
plasma of 4 2xTg-AD, 15 3xTg-AD, and 9 Wild Type
(total of 28 mice; 14 female, 14 male; age: mean = 8.17,
SD = 1.61, 5–11 months). Plasma samples were col-
lected retro-orbitally for 5 weeks and at euthanasia via
heart puncture. NDEs from the pooled serial blood
collections (NDE1) and the single endpoint (NDE2)
were immunocaptured by targeting the neuronal mar-
ker L1CAM. We measured human total Tau and
pThr181-Tau (p-Tau) in NDEs and cortex and hippo-
campus homogenates using a Luminex multiarray.
Results: Overall, there were strong positive correlations
for both total Tau and p-Tau between NDEs and brain

positive correlations with levels in the cortex and hip-
pocampus (r = 0.6885 and 0.7026, p < 0.0001, cortex vs
NDE1 and NDE2; r = 0.4958, p = 0.0073, hippocampus
vs NDE1; r = 0.6058, p = 0.0006, hippocampus vs
NDE2). Levels of p-Tau in NDE1 showed positive
correlations with levels in the cortex (r = 0.4640,
p
=

and
hippocampus
(r
=
0.6086,

for NDE2 (r = 0.1152, p = 0.6273 vs cortex; r = 0.0531,
p = 0.7926 vs hippocampus).
Summary/Conclusion: Tau levels in circulating NDEs
reflect levels in cortex and hippocampus across AD
model mice, supporting their convergent validity as
“liquid biopsy” biomarkers for AD.

Introduction: Amyloid beta is a pathologic hallmark of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however, the mechanism of
Aβ neurotoxicity is not fully understood. It has been
reported that exosomes associate with Aβ, but it is not
clear how this association affects Aβ neurotoxicity.
Methods: Here we utilized several techniques to isolate
exosomes from the sera of wild type (WT) and AD
transgenic mouse model.
(5xFAD) as well as Alzheimer’s patients and healthy
controls. We used Exoquick, Exoeasy, sequential ultra-
centrifugation, and size exclusion chromatography.
Particles’ size and number were characterized by nano-
particle tracking analysis (ZetaView).
Results: We report that the sphingolipid ceramide
mediates neurotoxicity of Aβ. We show that sera
from AD transgenic mouse model (5xFAD) and AD
patients, but not the WT or healthy controls, contain a
subpopulation of astrocyte-derived exosomes that are
enriched with ceramide and are prone to aggregation
(termed astrosomes) as confirmed by nanoparticle
tracking and cluster analyses. When taken up by

these astrosomes are shuttled to mitochondria where
they induce mitochondria clustering, evident by eleva-
tion of expression of the fission protein dynamin-
related protein1 (Drp1). Using proximity ligation
assays, we show that Aβ forms a complex with voltage
dependent anion channel 1 (VDA1), a protein that
functions as a gatekeeper for the entry and exit of
mitochondrial metabolites and is a key player in mito-
chondria-mediated
apoptosis.
Complex
formation
colocalized with ceramide cotransported with Aβ by
astrosomes. The interaction between Aβ and VDAC1
leads to caspase3 activation and subsequently apopto-
sis. Aβ-associated exosomes, not Aβ alone, induced
neurite fragmentation and neuronal death, suggesting
that association with astrosomes substantially enhances
Aβ neurotoxicity in AD. Interestingly, the novel cera-
mide analogue N-oleoyl serinol (S18) prevented the
aggregation of exosomes, and Aβ association with
astrosomes, and reduced Aβ interaction with VDAC1,
suggesting that exosomal ceramide mediated binding
of Aβ to astrosomes and mitochondrial damage.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that the asso-
ciation of Aβ with ceramide in astrosomes enhances
Aβ interaction with VDAC1 and mediates Aβ neuro-
toxicity in AD, which can be prevented by novel cer-
amide analogues.

Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis is the most common
chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the
central nervous system, affecting more than 2 million
people worldwide. MS is a multifactorial, immune-
mediated disease caused by complex genetic and envir-
onmental interactions. In recent years, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) have been described as powerful media-
tors of the modulation of biological processes (e.g.
inflammatory and immune response) following envir-
onmental exposures such as Particulate Matter (PM),
and have been described altered in MS. We character-
ized EVs in 48 patients with MS and 20 healthy sub-
jects matched for age and gender and evaluated the
effects of PM exposure on EV release patients with MS
compared with controls.
Methods: EVs isolated from blood samples were char-
acterized by nanotracking analysis and by flow cyto-
metry after labelling with the following markers: CD14
+ (monocyte), CD61+ (platelet), CD66+ (neutrophil),
CD25+ (T-reg), and CD105+ (endothelium). PM10
and PM2.5 concentrations at the residency of each
subject were obtained from the regional air quality
monitoring network.
Results: We observed decreased concentrations of
CD14+ (p < 0.05), CD61+ (p < 0.003), CD66+
(p < 0.009), CD25+ (p < 0.003), and CD105+
(p < 0.003) in patients compared with controls. In
cases, PM was inversely associated with CD14+ EVs
(PM2.5, β = −0.03; p < 0.05), CD66+ EVs (PM2.5
β = −0.03; p < 0.03), and CD25+ EVs (PM10
β = −0.02; p < 0.04; PM2.5, β = −0.03; p < 0.02). On
the contrary, in controls PM was positively associated
with CD14+ EVs (PM10 β = 0.02; p < 0.03; PM2.5,
β = 0.03; p < 0.02).
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings showed a differ-
ent composition of blood-derived EV subpopulations
in patients compared with controls. Moreover, we
observed that patients and controls react differently to
PM exposure in terms of blood-derived EV release,
suggesting the involvement of this mechanism in the
modulation
of
both
inflammatory
and
immune
responses, and thus in MS pathogenesis.

biosignature of brain cells-derived exosomes associated
with opioid addiction in a non-human primate (NHP)
model of OUD in which Cynomolgus monkeys per-
form cognitive tasks and self-administer (SA) intrave-
nous oxycodone daily. We also characterized the
systemic adverse effects of the brain cells-derived exo-
somes from drug-naïve and oxycodone SA monkeys.
Methods: We isolated total exosomes (TE) by ultracen-
trifugation and ExoQuick methods from the plasma of
male monkeys self-administrating oxycodone for 3
years and naive monkeys. Subsequently, from the TE
population,
we
isolated
neuron-derived
exosomes
(NDE) and astrocytes-derived exosomes (ADE) using
surface
biomarkers

(L1

and
GLAST
(Glutamate
Aspartate
Transporter), respectively. This novel method involved
streptavidin coated magnetic beads and photo-cleava-
ble (PC) biotin, providing us biologically intact exo-
somes useful for co-culture studies. We characterized
the exosomes by nanoparticle tracking analyses (NTA),
Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunogold label-
ling, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ELISAs
and mass spectrometry. Respirometric profiling in car-
diac myoblasts and monocytes following exosomes
treatment was performed by Seahorse XF.
Results: The quality of isolated exosomes (TE, NDE,
and ADE) was confirmed by NTA (size distribution
and concentration), Western blotting (e.g. CD9) and
TEM (size and shape). NTA did not show any signifi-
cant difference in exosomes size and concentration
(number per ml) between control and oxycodone SA
groups. Flow cytometry (e.g. L1CAM and GLAST)
and
immunogold
labelling
(CD9,
CD63
and
L1CAM) confirmed the purity of NDE and ADE iso-
lated from TE. Proteomics analyses of TE, NDE and
ADE identified several unique proteins present in
exosomes
from
the
oxycodone
SA
group.
Interestingly, we observed significantly higher expres-
sion of neurodegeneration markers neurofilament
light protein (NFL) and alpha-synuclein in NDE and
ADE of oxycodone SA group compared to controls.
Furthermore, TE treatment of H9C2 cardiac myo-
blasts and RAW264.7 monocytes significantly com-
promised their mitochondrial metabolism (basal and
maximum respiratory capacity).
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest the utility
of plasma exosomes as biomarkers for better under-
standing of the neurodegenerative and systemic effects
of oxycodone addiction.

Vesicles released during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: immuno-
modulatory (glyco)lipids and role in host-pathogen interactions
Emilie Layre, Pierre Boyer and Jerome Nigou
CNRS-Université Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France
Introduction: The tuberculosis disease remains one of
the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved strategies to evade
immune responses and to persist within the hostile
intracellular environment of alveolar macrophages.
The current lack of efficient anti-tuberculosis strategies
is largely due to our incomplete understanding of the
host-pathogen interactions of Mtb infection. Vesicles
released by the bacillus itself (bacterial membrane vesi-
cles, BMV) and by infected cells (host extracellular
vesicles, HEV) have immunomodulatory properties in
vitro and when administered to animals. If vesicles
likely play key role in host-pathogen interactions of
the Tuberculosis infection, their content in bacterial
factors, their uptake, trafficking and interaction with
host cells receptors remain incompletely deciphered.
Methods: BMV and HEV have been purified by com-
bining differential centrifugation, density gradient and
exclusion chromatography. After characterization by
microscopy, NanoSight and western blot, their content
in bacterial (glyco)lipids has been characterized by the
use of high sensitivity mass spectrometry-based lipido-
mic approach. BMV have been tested for their capacity
to activate reporter cell lines of pattern recognition
receptors. In addition, fluorescent-labelled BMV have
been used to study their uptake by host cells thank to
super-resolution microscopy.
Results: We have undertaken to characterize the con-
tent, the trafficking and interaction with pattern recog-
nition receptors of BMV and HEV released during
infection by mycobacteria of variable virulence. We
have importantly optimized the purification of BMV
showing that lipoproteins aggregates are co-purified
with vesicles on density gradient. SFC-MS lipidomic
analyses allowed the characterization of the repertoire
of immunomodulatory bacterial lipids released by
BMV and HEV, which excluded a continuum between
these two release pathways. Preliminary, assays have
shown that these vesicles are capable to interact with
different pattern recognition receptors including TLR
and lectins. Finally, we have been able to visualize
fluorescent-labelled vesicles uptake by macrophages
using superresolution microscopy.
Summary/Conclusion: During M. tuberculosis infec-
tion, the bacillus as well as infected cells release vesicles
that harbour different content in immunomodulatory
bacterial (glyco)lipids, including strain-specific lipids.
These vesicles likely play important role in host-patho-
gen interactions by modulating immune response
beyond the infected cells, in part through their inter-
action with different pattern recognition receptors.

Introduction: Conventional diagnoses of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) rely on quantifying bacteria in sputum
samples, which make it incapable of measuring the body’s
total bacterial load and diagnosing patients that have
difficulty producing sputum – such as children and
those that are HIV-positive. Nanoscale (30–200 nm)
outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which are shed from
their bacterial cells of origin and circulate in the blood-
stream, have been found to contain rich molecular infor-
mation from their mother cells. Despite the diagnostic
potential, their nanoscale size in the presence of high
background has complicated the use of these promising
biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Methods:
Here
we
report
two
complementary
approaches to systematically discover and clinically
detect Mtb-derived OMVs using protein and RNA
biomarkers. First, we employ a digital droplet ELISA
on whole, unprocessed samples to detect and quantify
the presence of these OMVs using surface protein
markers. Second, we have developed a platform to
specifically enrich for Mtb-derived OMVs using our
previously developed magnetic nanopore platform,
wherein millions of nanofluidic devices are operated
in parallel, increasing throughput relative to a single
nanofluidic
device
by
a
million-fold.
Using
this
approach, we identify RNAs that are specifically
enriched in Mtb-derived OMVs and can be used to
identify TB strain, infectious activity, and total body
burden.
Results: Using these platforms, we enriched for Mtb-
derived OMVs from plasma and profiled their cargo,
both proteins and RNA. We first determined a panel of
protein biomarkers for multiplexed detection of OMVs
through a digital droplet sandwich ELISA. We then
tested our protein markers on spiked plasma samples
as models for clinical TB samples. Simultaneously, we
performed RNA sequencing and discovered a panel of
RNA biomarkers that are preferentially enriched in
OMVs. We picked ten of the most highly-expressed
RNA biomarkers and also tested for them on spiked
plasma samples using our magnetic nanopore platform.
Summary/Conclusion: These results demonstrate the
capability of OMV biomarkers in the development of
novel liquid biopsy based Mtb diagnostics. Building on
this work, we are working with clinical collaborators to
test our assays on clinical samples from Philadelphia
and west Africa.

Introduction: A dearth of knowledge exists regarding
the molecular mechanisms by which host exosomes
regulate immune response to infections caused by
gram-negative pathogens. To address this gap in
knowledge, our laboratory has been using two well-
established model organisms; Yersinia pestis (Yp),
and Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp). Yp and Bp
cause the emerging human diseases plague and melioi-
dosis respectively. Currently, no licenced vaccines or
highly effective therapeutics are available for either
disease.
Methods: EX were purified from naïve U937 mono-
cytes (EXu) and infected U937 (EXi) by serial centri-
fugation
followed
by
sucrose
density
gradient
purification, and characterized by TEM, ZetaView
nanoparticle tracking, and exosome markers (CD63,
TSG101, and Flotillin-1). Immune responses of naïve
U937 cells and response mechanisms were analysed
following treatment with equivalent amounts of EXi
or EXu (as control). These included macrophage dif-
ferentiation assays, multiplex measurements of inflam-
matory
cytokines,
bacterial
clearance
assays,
quantitative protein microarray analysis of 173 host
signalling proteins, siRNA knockdown of EXi-induced
cytokines in recipient cells, and mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis of EXi contents. For all assays, at least
four biological replicates were performed.
Results:
EXi
induce
monocyte
differentiation
to
macrophages and dramatic release of IL-6, IL-8 and
IL-10 cytokines, effects that are also seen when mono-
cytes are infected with the bacteria. The EXi also
induce a substantial increase in the capacity of the
recipient monocytes to clear bacteria in an IL-6-depen-
dent manner. Specific host signalling molecules are
strongly modulated by the EXi, including p38, Jak2
and ALK for EXi-Yp, influencing the observed pheno-
types. MS analysis showed lack of LPS in EXi-Yp and
demonstrated the presence of specific bacterial proteins
that have antigenic properties.
Summary/Conclusion: We have identified some of the
molecular mechanisms by which EXi assist the host in
clearing infection. EXi prime distant naïve monocytes
through modulation of distinct pathways such as p38
to mount immune responses similar to when they
become infected. These include differentiation to
macrophages and migration to infection site for
increased IL-6-dependent bacterial clearance.

Introduction: Recruitment of monocytes to sites of
infection is important in restricting growth and inva-
sion of various microorganisms such as pathogenic
fungi C. albicans. Beside complement supported pha-
gocytosis and extracellular trap formation, human
monocytes secrete extracellular vesicles which are cru-
cial in cellular communication in physiology and
pathophysiology as they transfer proteins, lipid, and
nucleic acids. The current study attempts to shed
light on immune evasion mechanisms by C. albicans
via extracellular vesicles.
Methods: Human monocytes were isolated by mag-
netic beads technique and extracellular vesicles were
isolated using polymer precipitation or ultracentrifuga-
tion or size exclusion chromatography. Vesicles were
characterized by ELISA, LC/MS-based proteomics,
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as well as
electron- and dynamic light scattering microscopy, etc.
CRISPR-CAS9 based genome editing was performed to
knockout CD11b in human monocytic THP-1 cells.
Effect of isolated vesicles were determined by using
proximity ligation assay (PLA), ELISA, Western Blot,
next
generation
RNA
sequencing,
QPCR,
Immunohistochemistry, etc.
Results: Here we show for the first time that human
blood derived monocytes alone and in a whole blood
model strongly induced and released extracellular vesi-
cles in response to the pathogenic fungus C. albicans.
One induced population carried the anti-inflammatory
cytokine TGFβ-1. Release of these vesicles is triggered
by binding of soluble β-glucan from C. albicans to the
CR3 receptor on monocytes as demonstrated by
CRISPR-CAS9 based CR3 genome editing in THP-1
cells, and by using CR3 knock out mice. Isolated TGF-
β1-transporting vesicles reduced the inflammatory
response in human M1 macrophages and in a whole
blood model. The anti-inflammatory effect by TGF-β1-
transporting vesicles is investigated in detail and results
in inhibition of IL-1β gene transcription.
Summary/Conclusion: Showing that human apoptotic
bodies similarly induced TGF-β1-transporting vesicles
from human monocytes we hypothesize that C. albi-
cans hijacks this new CR3-dependent anti-inflamma-
tory vesicle pathway for immune escape.

Introduction: To date, most research involving extra-
cellular RNAs has focused in RNAs encapsulated inside
extracellular vesicles (EVs) or in total unfractionated
biofluids. It is known that exRNAs also exist outside
vesicles or in lipoprotein particles. However, nonvesi-
cular exRNAs remain widely uncharacterized despite
being a feasible source of contaminants in EV prepara-
tions. Our interest in nonvesicular exRNAs arises from
the observation that some small RNAs, such as specific
tRNA-derived fragments, have much higher relative
representation in this extracellular fraction. At least in
part, this enrichment seems to be a consequence of
their differential extracellular stability.
Methods: To get a representative picture of the whole
set of RNAs released to the extracellular nonvesicular
space by cultured human cells, we inhibited extracel-
lular degradation by adding recombinant ribonuclease
inhibitor to the cell-conditioned media and studied the
kinetics of RNA release and degradation. High-resolu-
tion iodixanol gradients were used to separate EVs
from extracellular RNPs or vesicle-free RNA. The con-
version rate between parental ncRNAs and their frag-
ments was studied by high-throughput sequencing and
Northern blot.
Results: The inhibition of extracellular RNase activity
revealed the presence of full-length tRNAs and ribo-
somes in the extracellular space of a variety of malig-
nant
and
non-malignant
cell
lines.
Extracellular
ribosomes co-isolate with EVs purified by ultracentri-
fugation or size-exclusion chromatography, but not
with EVs purified by density gradients.These ncRNAs
are substrates of extracellular RNases, demonstrating
an extracellular biogenesis route for the formation of
ncRNA-derived fragments, some of which achieve
remarkable stability and can be detected in biofluids.
We also highlight the immunoregulatory potential of
purified RNA-containing extracellular complexes.
Summary/Conclusion:
In
conclusion,
ribonuclease
inhibition dramatically shapes extracellular RNA pro-
files and uncovers a population of extracellular ribo-
somes, tRNAs and other coding and noncoding RNAs
which exists outside EVs. Although these RNAs are
prone to degradation, some of their fragments can
accumulate in cell culture media and in biofluids.
This dynamic view of exRNAs impacts our under-
standing of RNA secretion mechanisms and may offer
a window to new molecules with biomarker potential.
In contrast, EVs confer an RNase-protected environ-
ment and contain more full-length ncRNAs (tRNAs,
YRNAs, 7SL RNAs, rRNAs depending on vesicle size)
than their fragments.

Introduction: CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed mem-
brane protein that functions as a receptor for throm-
bospondin-1 and the counter receptor for signal
regulatory protein-α in phagocytes. High expression
of CD47 is associated with a poor prognosis for some
cancers. Conversely, CD47 blocking agents are in clin-
ical trials for enhancing innate and adaptive antitumor
immunity in cancer patients. These studies suggest
utility of CD47 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomar-
ker and as a therapeutic target. CD47 is also expressed
on extracellular vesicles (EVs), and we reported that
CD47 expression identifies a distinct population of EVs
from those that express the traditional EV markers
CD63 or MHC1. CD47-, CD63- and MHC1-enriched
vesicles
contain
distinct
small
RNA
populations
(PMID: 29416092), and these differ in RNA content
from EVs that lack any of these markers. The mechan-
isms by which CD47 directly or indirectly regulates
which RNAs are packaged into EV remain unknown.
Methods: To elucidate the mechanism by which
CD47 regulates EV RNA composition and function,
we performed global miRNA microarray analysis
between EVs produced by wild type and CD47-defi-
cient T cells. Results were further validated using
real-time
PCR
and
RNA-immunoprecipitation.
Interactions
between
CD47
and
exportin-1/Ran
complex was identified by mass spectrometry and
confirmed by using co-immunoprecipitation, subcel-
lular localization, flow cytometry, and confocal and
electron microscopy.
Results: EV released from CD47-deficient human T
cells and in cd47-/- mouse plasma were enriched in
5ʹ-7-methylguanosine-capped microRNAs and mRNAs
that depend on the exportin-1/RanGTP pathway.
Knockdown of CD47 in wild type cells or thrombos-
pondin-1 treatment correspondingly enhanced levels of
capped-RNAs released in EV and re-expressing CD47
in null cells decreased their levels. Mass spectrometry
and co-immunoprecipitation identified specific inter-
actions of CD47 with components of the exportin-1/
Ran nuclear export complex and its known cargos and
between the CD47 cytoplasmic adapter ubiquilin-1 and
the exportin-1/Ran complex. Interaction of CD47 with
exportin-1 was inhibited by leptomycin B, which inac-
tivates exportin-1 and increased levels of cap-depen-
dent RNAs in EV released from wild type but not
CD47-deficient cells.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings indicate that
CD47-dependent thrombospondin-1 signalling regu-
lates cytoplasmic levels of cap-dependent RNAs in T
cells at least in part through ubiquilin-1- and GTP-
dependent physical interactions with the exportin-1/
Ran transport complex, which regulate levels of specific
pre-miRNAs
and
mRNAs
available
for
sorting
into EVs.

Introduction: Desmoglein 2 (Dsg2), is a palmitoylated
cadherin
that
is
involved
in
cell-cell
adhesion.
Interestingly, Dsg2 promotes mitogenic cell signalling
and is upregulated in many cancers, including SCC,
contributing to poor prognosis and survivability. We
recently demonstrated that Dsg2 promotes EV release,
but the mechanism by which Dsg2 enhances EV bio-
genesis
and
role
of
palmitoylation
is
poorly
understood.
Methods: Pharmacological drug inhibitors 2-bromo-
palmitate, GW4869, and Bafilomycin A1 were used.
Stable SCC cell lines were established by retrovirus
infection expressing GFP, wild type Dsg2/GFP, or pal-
mitoylation deficient Dsg2cacs/GFP. EVs were isolated
by sequential ultracentrifugation and iodixanol gradi-
ent separation and analysed by NTA. Proteins asso-
ciated with the endocytic pathway were analysed by
immunofluorescence and imaged by confocal micro-
scopy or immunoblotting and signals were quantitated
using ImageStudio.

Results: Here we demonstrate that the effect of Dsg2
on EV release was reduced by the palmitoylation inhi-
bitor 2-bromopalmitate. Furthermore, mutations that
prevented
palmitoylation
(Dsg2cacs)
dramatically
abrogated EV release by targeting of un-palmitoylated
Dsg2 to the lysosomes for degradation. Dsg2 increased
expression and subcellular localization of FLOT1, a
membrane lipid raft protein critical for membrane
invagination. Dsg2 also altered membrane localization
of several early (EPS15 and EEA1), but not late (Rab7,
Rab11, and HRS), endocytic pathway proteins. Loss of
palmitoylation in the Dsg2cacs mutants abrogated
these effects. Finally, Dsg2-induced EV release was
abrogated by the sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869
or
augmented
by
the
V-ATPase
inhibitor
Bafilomycin A1.
Summary/Conclusion: The combined results of the
drug treatments and functional mutations of Dsg2
suggest that Dsg2 plays a critical role in EV biogenesis
by modulating proteins involved in early endosome
sorting
and
is
dependent
on
post-translational
palmitoylation.

Introduction: The translation initiation factor eIF4E
(4E) is an oncogenic protein that is upregulated in
30% of cancers including a subgroup of acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) patients. EIF4E regulates post-tran-
scriptional RNA processing including the nuclear
export and/or translation of mRNA transcripts. In par-
ticular, it selectively increases the expression of genes
that have a prominent role in cancer progression such
as MYC, cyclin D1, and MCL1. Furthermore, our lab
pioneered studies demonstrating that a subset of 4E-
high AML patients is clinically responsive to treatment
with a 4E inhibitor (Ribavirin) indicating the impor-
tance of 4E in AML progression and its relevance as a
therapeutic target. We investigated an as yet unex-
plored perspective of 4E- whether the oncogenic role
of 4E is in part mediated by its function as a master
regulator of vesiculation.
Methods: To assess mRNA export and identify 4E-
bound mRNA targets that correspond to vesiculation-
related genes and associated cargo, we used cellular
fractionation and RNA immunoprecipitation techni-
ques. To determine whether 4E regulates the number
of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released as well as their
protein and RNA cargo we used Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA) as well as mass spectrometry, antibody
microarrays, and RNA sequencing technologies.
Results: EIF4E upregulates cellular protein levels of the
vesiculation marker CD63 by increasing its nuclear
export. In addition to increased cellular expression,
CD63, CD81, CD9, and flotillin-1 proteins are elevated
in EVs released from 4E-high cells. This is also asso-
ciated with an increased release of vesicles that are 50–
200 nm in size. Currently, we have validated the upre-
gulation of several receptors and cytosolic proteins in
EVs isolated from 4E-overexpressing cells that function
in cell growth, migration, invasion, and stemness. The
most abundant RNAs in our EV preparations are
microRNAs (miRs) and we have confirmed downregu-
lation of several of these.
Summary/Conclusion: Our work shows that 4E repro-
grams the vesiculation of cancer cells changing the
release and cargo of EVs. This may impact cellular
communication and tumour biology, which we are
currently addressing in functional studies. We hope
that these studies will highlight novel therapeutic stra-
tegies for AML patients.

Introduction: Cognitive and memory impairments
worsen with time in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), likely
due to a progressive loss of hippocampal neurogenesis,
and escalation of neuroinflammation. These changes
are also accompanied by increased deposition of amy-
loid plaques in the brain.
Methods: In this study, using the 5XFAD mouse
model, we examined the efficacy of extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) shed from the rat subventricular zone neural
stem cells (SVZ-NSCs) for disease modification. We
first purified EVs from the rat SVZ-NSC cultures
through ion-exchange chromatography and then admi-
nistered intranasally to 3-months old 5XFAD mice
(~75 billion/week for two weeks). Two months later,
the functional effects of EV treatment were quantified
through a series of behavioural tests, and animals were
euthanized for quantification of hippocampal neuro-
genesis, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and amy-
loid plaque deposition.
Results: In comparison to AD mice receiving vehicle,
AD mice receiving NSC-EVs displayed improved cog-
nitive function to discern minor changes in the envir-
onment in an object location test, better spatial
recognition memory in an object-in-place test, and
improved pattern separation ability in a pattern separa-
tion test. Besides, EV-treated AD mice displayed no
anhedonia in a sucrose preference test. Analyses of
neurogenesis using the birth-dating marker 5ʹ-bromo-
deoxyuridine and the newly born neuron marker dou-
blecortin revealed maintenance of a higher level of
hippocampal neurogenesis in AD mice receiving EVs,
in comparison to vehicle-treated AD mice. Moreover,
analyses of brain tissues from EV-treated AD mice
revealed decreased concentrations of oxidative stress
markers malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls and
elevated levels of antioxidants catalase and superoxide
dismutase. Also, the concentration of proinflammatory
cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleu-
kin-1 beta and the extent of amyloid plaques were
significantly
reduced
in
EV
treated
AD
mice.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced hyper-
trophy of astrocytes.
Summary/Conclusion: Intranasal administration of
NSC-derived EVs restrains the deterioration of cogni-
tive and mood dysfunction of AD by maintaining
higher levels of neurogenesis and curtailing the pro-
gression of neuroinflammation.

perspectives in the use of iPSC in regenerative medicine.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of
iPSC-EV in the treatment of kidney disease.
Methods: The iPSC were generated from skin fibro-
blast
after

38583914.7.0000.5257/933.018). The EV were isolated
from iPSC supernatants (cultured 24 h in mTeSR-1
medium) by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g for 2 h at
4°C). Characterization of iPSC-EV was performed
using ZetaView, TEM, ExoView™Tetraspanin Kit and
MACSPlex Exosome Kit. For in vitro injury, renal
epithelial cells were cultured under hypoxia (1% O2).
For in vivo injury, male Wistar rats were submitted to
bilateral renal arterial clamping (45 min) followed by
reperfusion without or with injection of iPSC-EV
(Protocol approval: Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro – 043/19). Kidney damage was assessed by
histological
and
immunohistochemistry
analyses
(PCNA, TUNEL and ED-1). Modulation of RNA levels
was assessed by RT2 Profiler PCR array.
Results: The results show that iPSC-EV reduce renal cell
death, tissue damage, macrophage infiltration, promote
mitochondria protection and ameliorate renal function.
The iPSC-EV mechanism of action is related to the
regulation of key genes known to prevent damage caused
by oxidative stress like GSTK1, SOD1, SOD3, TXN1 and
TXNRD2. Characterization of iPSC-EV showed that
iPSC-EV can carry important molecules that can support
renal recovery as EpCAM and Prominin-1.
Summary/Conclusion: iPSC-EV presents renoprotec-
tive properties, acting on different aspects of AKI. This
presents a new relevant application of iPSC as a source
of EV for therapeutic purpose in kidney diseases.

cell-derived extracellular vesicles

Introduction:
Incomplete
lung
development,
also
known as pulmonary hypoplasia (PH), is a recognized
cause of neonatal death. We have previously shown
that experimental PH can be rescued by the adminis-
tration of extracellular vesicles derived from amniotic
fluid stem cells (AFSC-EVs) through an RNA-mediated
mechanism. This effect was not observed with EVs
derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs).
The aim of this study was to 1) evaluate which RNA
species were responsible for PH rescue, and 2) to define
the mechanism behind this effect.
Methods: EVs were isolated and characterized from
conditioned medium of rat AFSCs and rat MSCs (con-
trol
group)
using
ultracentrifugation.
EVs
were
assessed for size (nanoparticle tracking analysis), mor-
phology (TEM), and expression of CD63, Hsp70, Flo-1,
and TSG101 (Western).
To identify the mediators of AFSC-EVs, we used
DESeq (FDR<0.01) to differentially analyse RNA from:
A) ASFC-EV and MSC-EV cargo, isolated with SeraMir
and sequenced with NextSeq.
B) lung epithelial cells from rat PH lungs treated with
vehicle or AFSC-EVs. Epithelial cell RNA was iso-
lated with miRvana and sequenced with NextSeq.
We correlated AFSC-EV cargo miRNA with vali-
dated mRNA targets that were downregulated after
EV conditioning in lung epithelial cells.
Results: Of the RNA species contained in ASFC-EV
and MSC-EV cargo, miRNAs were the most propor-
tionally different between the two EV populations.
AFSC-EVs were enriched for miRNAs that are critical
for lung development, such as miR17 ~ 92 and their
paralogues that control lung branching morphogenesis.
AFSC-EV administration to PH lung cells significantly
downregulated 35 genes, which formed 415 miRNA-
mRNA reported interactions.
Summary/Conclusion: AFSC-EVs contain many RNA
species in their cargo, but miRNAs are the main effec-
tors of their ability to rescue underdeveloped foetal
lungs. We have identified for the first time that
AFSC-EV biological effect on underdeveloped foetal
lungs is in part due to the release of miR17 ~ 92 cluster.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are consid-
ered as key elements for future therapeutic and diag-
nostic
procedures.
However,
despite
enormous
research efforts to understand their physiological rele-
vance and several greatly successful clinical trials, EVs
are currently not authorized for clinical routines by
American or European regulation and approval agen-
cies. This is especially because therapeutic EVs are
produced or isolated from cell cultures or biofluids,
both of which are subjected to batch-to-batch varia-
tions and ill-defined contaminations. Therefore, com-
plementary
technologies
that
produce
EVs
as
reproducible and defined as state of the art nanother-
apeutics, would revolutionize the application of EVs in
clinical settings and provide the scientific community
with a holistic understanding of EV-mediated signal-
ling processes. In our study, we achieve de novo bot-
tom-up assembly of fully synthetic EVs (fsEVs) that
comprise identical physiological and therapeutic func-
tionalities to natural EVs.
Methods:
We
applied
droplet-based
microfluidic
synthesis to sequentially amalgamate synthetic lipids,
proteins and nucleic acids into defined vesicles that
display analogous therapeutic capabilities to natural
EVs. FsEVs were characterized by electron and confo-
cal microscopy, dynamic light scattering and mass
spectrometry and tested on organotypic models or in
vivo.
Results: Using previously described EVs as “nature-
given” blueprints, we assembled several fsEVs in
their exact molecular composition. In particular,
we produced wound-healing promoting EVs com-
posed
of
several
exosomal
proteins,
lipids
and
microRNAs and showed that their therapeutic per-
formance on human skin wounds is equivalent to
that of natural EVs. Besides their high molecular
complexity, being composed of dozens of different
molecular building-blocks, the presented fsEVs are
completely defined on a quantitative level. Based on
this, we achieved a stoichiometric understanding of
cell-vesicle interactions.
Summary/Conclusion:
By
applying
bottom-up
synthesis of fsEVs for quantitative studies on EV
signalling, we not only provide innovative and safe
compounds for EV-therapeutics but also a vastly
new perspective on the application spectrum of
extracellular vesicles in fundamental research.

Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
contain functional molecules from their cell of origin
and can enter recipient cells for intercellular com-
munication. IFNβ has been shown to induce some
lncRNAs to regulate host immune response and play
a major role in the positive regulation of the activity
of natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we aim to clarify
whether IFNβ induced sEVs can regulate the cyto-
toxicity of NK cells by transferring specific lncRNAs
into NK cells.
Methods: EVs were purified from A549 with/without
IFNβ treatment by serial centrifugation followed by
sucrose density gradient purification. ELISA assay
were performed to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of
NK cells. qPCR and Western Blot were used to verify
the expression of NKp46.
Results: Surprisingly, IFNβ induced sEVs can strengthen
the cytotoxicity of NK cells. Through human transcrip-
tome array (HTA) we found the expression levels of 69
lncRNAs were significantly changed within sEVs isolated
from A549 cells following IFNβ treatment. Additionally we
found a specific sEV cargo, linc-EPHA6-1, acted as a
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for hsa-miR-4485
which subsequently up-regulate the natural cytotoxicity
receptor (NKp46) expression. Furthermore, we verified
over-expression of linc-EPHA6-1 significantly enhance
the cytotoxicity of NK cells against Zika virus-infected
A549 cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that
IFNβ-induced linc-EPHA6-1 wrapped in sEVs can reg-
ulate the cytotoxicity of NK cells. Our study provides a
novel link between type I IFN and NK cells, which are
two major players for the host innate immunity against
pathogen infections.

Introduction: HIV-infected T cells release simulta-
neously viral particles and small extracellular vesicles
(sEVs) including MVB-derived exosomes and plasma
membrane-derived EVs. sEVs and HIV share many
physical and chemical characteristics, which makes
their separation difficult. Although several approaches
have been used to obtain sEVs free of virus they leave a
majority of sEVs within HIV preparations. For this
reason, the function of sEVs during HIV infection
remains unclear.
Methods: We have developed a novel un-biased pro-
teomic profiling approach to identify specific markers
of the virus or sEV subtypes released by a human T
lymphoma cell line. Our approach was to combine
differential centrifugation of medium/small EVs con-
tained in the CCM with quantitative mass spectrometry
to generate protein abundance profiles across the dif-
ferent sub-fractions. We generated an interactive data-
base to define groups of proteins with similar profiles,
suggesting their release in the same EVs.
Results: We thus identified different categories of EVs,
which bear different surface proteins, e.g. different
combinations of T cell surface markers, integrins or
tetraspanins. In EVs released by infected cells, we
identified cellular proteins behaving like HIV proteins,
and several that changed behaviour after infection,
either moving towards or away from the HIV cluster.
We
identified
two
cell-derived
proteins
that
are
included in the viral particles and one that is specific
of non-viral sEVs that are modified by infection, and
analysed their respective roles in controlling EV com-
position or virus infectivity.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
approach
presents
a
powerful tool for identification of common cargoes of
given EV subtypes, and could be now used to identify
modifications of EV composition in any given physio-
logical or pathological situation.

Introduction: Recent data indicate that naked viruses
belonging to the picornaviridae family can be released
from host cells via enclosure in extracellular vesicles
(EV). EV cloak virus particles in a host-derived “envel-
ope” and can thereby affect antiviral immune responses
and disease severity. A better understanding of the
formation and function of EV-enclosed viruses is
therefore required. Previously, we showed the presence
of the autophagosome marker LC3 in EV isolates from
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infected cells,
suggesting the involvement of a secretory autophagy

pathway in EV-mediated virus release. However, little
is known about the viral and host factors that regulate
this process. Here, we have assessed the role of the
EMCV Leader, a viral protein that is dispensable for
replication but is required for symptomatic disease.
Methods: Cells were infected with wildtype virus or a
mutant carrying an inactive Leader. EV produced dur-
ing the infection were isolated using differential ultra-
centrifugation and density gradient purification. EV
were characterized by high resolution flow cytometry
and their infectivity determined using end-point dilu-
tion assay. In addition, the fate of autophagosomes in
infected cells was monitored using a reporter assay for
autophagosome-lysosome fusion and analysis of the
secretion of autophagosomal proteins.
Results: Inactivation of the EMCV Leader strongly
reduced the release of EV-enclosed virus. Whereas
autophagosomes are typically degraded, we show this
is blocked by the Leader. Instead, autophagosomes fuse
with the plasma membrane, as indicated by the secre-
tion of autophagy marker LC3 during infection with
wildtype but not the mutant virus. Pharmacological
reactivation of degradative autophagy in infected cells
resulted in a strong reduction in the release of EV and
EV-enclosed virus. Similarly, the reduction in EV-
enclosed virus release in the absence of the Leader
could be partially reversed by drugs that promote the
secretion of autophagosomes.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data supports a role for
secretory autophagy in the release of viruses in EV, a
pathway that is regulated by the EMCV Leader. These
findings highlight an unconventional route for EV for-
mation that intersects with autophagosomal compart-
ments and contributes to viral pathogenesis.

Introduction: Zika virus (ZIKV) causes a public health
emergency of international concern because of its cor-
relation with microcephaly. During viral infection, the
innate immune response quickly to produce some
endogenous functional molecules which can prevent
viral invasion or replication. Extracellular vesicles
(EVs) contain molecules from their cell of origin
under virus infection and can enter recipient cells for
intercellular communication. Here, we aim to clarify
whether ZIKV induced EVs can regulate viral patho-
genicity by transferring specific RNA.
Methods: EVs were purified from A549 with/without
ZIKV infection by serial centrifugation followed by sucrose
density gradient purification. Human transcriptome array
(HTA) was used to found RNA expression within EVs.
Flow Cytometry was used to determine cell cycles. ZIKV
replication was assayed by qPCR and Western Blot. Flow
Cytometry was used to determine cell cycles.
Results: Through HTA we found the defensin alpha 1B
(DEFA1B)
expression
was
significantly
increased
within EVs isolated from ZIKV infected A549 cells.
Additionally, we found that the extracellular DEFA1B
but not the intracellular DEFA1B exerts anti-ZIKV
effect mainly before entry step. Surprisingly, up-regu-
late DEFA1B can retard cell cycles of host cell. We
verified DEFA1B could bind with the origin recogni-
tion complex 1 (ORC1) which is required to start DNA
replication during the cell cycle. Furthermore, up-reg-
ulate DEFA1B decreased the ORC1 level in nuclear.
Interestingly, EVs with DEFA1B can internalize into
recipient cells and inhibit their cell cycles.
Summary/Conclusion: Together, our results demon-
strated that ZIKV infection can induce DEFA1B
wrapped in EVs, and DEFA1B not only exerts anti-
ZIKV effect but also regulate cell cycles which may
affect neurodevelopment. Our study provides a novel
viewpoint that DEFA1B act as first-line anti-viral mole-
cules during ZIKV infection also correlate with neuro-
development by retarding cell cycles.

mediating these infections. During respiratory infection,
EVs are shown to have a modulatory effect: promoting or
suppressing infection dependent on the pathogen and cell
type. In the age of next-generation sequencing, we now
appreciate that many respiratory infections are polymicro-
bial in nature, with viral-bacterial co-infections correlating
with worse disease outcomes. Epidemiological studies cor-
relate acute viral infections with the increased likelihood
and severity of both acute and chronic secondary bacterial
infections; however, the exact mechanisms of these inter-
actions remain poorly understood. EVs have been under-
studied in the context of respiratory viral-bacterial co-
infections; thus, their role in mediating these infections is
relatively unknown. Unpublished data from the lab shows
thatin airway epithelial cells (AECs), viral infectioninduces
the release of EVs that associate with Pseudomonas aeru-
ginosa (Pa) and promote biofilm growth. Here, we aim to
expand upon these findings and determine how AEC EVs
mediate Pa-immune cell interactions during respiratory
viral-bacterial co-infection.
Methods: To determine how exposure to EVs impacts
Pa-immune cell interactions, EVs were isolated from
the apical secretions of AECs and co-cultured with Pa.
EV-treated Pa was then co-cultured with macrophages
to evaluate EV impact on Pa uptake and survival.
Results: In preliminary experiments using control EVs, we
observed that EVs associate with Pa. Interestingly, during
co-culture with macrophages, EV-treated Pa are more
susceptible to phagocytosis in comparison to non-treated
Pa. However, after 4 hours of co-culture with macrophages,
EV-treated Pa are able to survive and replicate, while non-
treated Pa are effectively controlled by the macrophages.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings suggest that while
Pa-EV association promotes Pa uptake, it may ultimately
enhance Pa immune evasion and survival. Ongoing experi-
ments in the lab are evaluating the mechanism of Pa-EV
association and how EVs from virus-infected AECs affect
the phenotypes observed with control EVs. Notably, this is
one of few reports of a mammalian EV influencing the
pathogenesis of a bacterium; thus, results from these
experiments will define the function of AEC EVs in reg-
ulating bacterial-immune cell interactions during respira-
tory co-infections.

Introduction: Objective biomarkers are needed to
assess and predict neuronal function and cognitive
impairment. In people ageing with chronic infections,
such as HIV, determining the mechanism of impair-
ment will be important when therapies are available.
Methods: Sixty plasma samples from HIV-infected people
were obtained from NIH-sponsored AIDS banks. Clinical
and epidemiological data were collected. All underwent
neuropsychological testing and 40 were considered
impaired. Neuronal extracellular vesicles (nEVs) were iso-
lated from plasma and assayed for high-mobility group box
1 (HMGB1), neurofilament (NF-L) and phosphorylated
tau-181 (p-tau) proteins.
Results: Using 3 different algorithms, Support Vector
Machines (SVM) performed the best with an area
under the curve (AUC) value of 0.82 ± 0.16. Using 4
different combinations of clinical data and the 3 nEV
protein targets, selected clinical data and HMGB1 best
predicted cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.82). The
most
important
features
included
CD4
count,
HMGB1, NF-L and education.
Summary/Conclusion: Specific clinical features plus
nEV HMGB1, an inflammatory marker, were the best
predictors of cognitive impairment. Previous published
data showed nEV p-tau-181 elevated in Alzheimer’s
disease and in this study p-tau had no importance in
assessing HIV-associated cognitive impairment. nEV
target discovery can be improved to better identify
neuronal damage, possibly to differentiate other neu-
rodegenerative diseases and hopefully recovery after
therapies are identified.

tracking analysis, Western Blot, RT-qPCR, virus rescue
assay.
Results: We have attempted to address the kinetics
of EV and virus release from multiple-infected cells
using serum starvation experiments from infected
(100%) cells. These infected cells were initially put
in G0 quiescent stage using serum starvation. Both
supernatants and cell pellets were collected post-
induction release (20% FBS + PMA/PHA) at 0, 3, 6,
12, and 24 hours and examined for the presence of
EV, autophagy and viral proteins as well as viral
RNA expression. Results from supernatants of unin-
fected cells showed a peak of tetraspanin proteins
(CD63, CD81, and CD9) at 6 hours and a gradual
decrease of all EV associated proteins by 24 hours.
However, the EV from HIV-1 infected cells showed
all three tetraspanins present at 3 hours and expres-
sion gradually increased up to 24 hours. When com-
pared to HTLV-1 infected cells, the three tetraspanin
proteins peaked at 6 hours and expression continued
to decrease up to 24 hours. HTLV-1 infected cells
also showed a unique pattern of CD81 expression.
Autophagy associated proteins (LC3A, LC3B and
p62) from uninfected cells and HTLV-1 infected
cells plateaued at 6 hours, whereas in HIV-1 infected
cells their expression continued to increase and
peaked at 24 hours. HIV-1 viral proteins (p24,
gp120, Nef) expression was present at 6 hours and
continued to increase and peaked at 24 hours.
HTLV-1 proteins (p19 and gp46/61) peaked at
6 hours and gradually decreased overtime. HIV-1
and HTLV-1 RNA gene expression analysis was per-
formed,
and data
correlated with viral protein
expression. Additionally, EVs release was quantified
and showed significant increase of EV concentration
overtime in both uninfected and infected samples.
Finally, experiments of infectivity from 6- and 24-
hour supernatants were performed on three naive
cells. HIV-1 supernatant 6- hour sample was found
not to be infectious. However, HIV-1 was success-
fully rescued from 24-hour sample.
Summary/Conclusion: Collectively, our data indicates
that EV release may occur prior to viral release in
infected cells, thereby implicating a potentially signifi-
cant effect of EVs on uninfected recipient cells prior to
subsequent viral infection.

Introduction: Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are
important intercellular communicators. By systems
biology integration, uEVs prove to be relevant in geni-
tourinary disease detection. However, it has recently
been shown that labelled EVs administered to the cir-
culation can be detected in the urinary system, as well.
Thus, this pilot study aimed at phenotyping haemato-
poietic surface markers on uEVs to create enough
plausibility for future non-invasive biomarker studies
of circulation and immune disorders that may translate
into urine but are not yet timely recognized.
Methods: Urine was obtained from healthy men sign-
ing a written informed consent (n = 31). Sampling was
approved by the local ethics committee and in compli-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Cell-free urine
was obtained by serial centrifugation and 10 ml, each,
were utilized for the MACSPlex Exosome Kit, human
(Miltenyi Biotec). The manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions were followed to examine 37 distinct uEV surface
markers of CD9+/CD63+/CD81+ vesicles in a multi-
plexed bead-based manner including respective con-
trols. The Accuri C6 (BD) was utilized for data
acquisition.
For further MISEV2018-compliant characterization,
CD9+/CD63+/CD81+ uEVs were isolated by immu-
noaffinity and analysed by fluorescence nanoparticle
tracking (f-NTA), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and western blotting (WB).
Urinary creatinine (Ucrea) was determined to con-
trol for variances in urinary dilutions and used for data
normalization.
Results: Except CD209, all other 36 surface markers
could be identified. The most abundant markers were
CD9 and CD63, which were detected in 93% of sam-
ples, followed by CD133/1 (84%), CD326 (81%), CD81
and CD24 (77%, each). CD3 (42%), CD9, CD45 (39%),
CD49e (32%) and CD81 showed similar relative med-
ian fluorescent intensities (rMFI), while CD63 yielded
significantly higher (p = 0.009) and all other markers
significantly lower rMFI (p < 0.011).
TEM
and
f-NTA
revealed
cup-shaped
vesicles
(137 ± 22 nm) with 8.8 ± 7.0 E + 10 particles/g
Ucrea. WB indicated uEV isolates that were positive
for Alix, Syntenin, TSG101, CD9, CD63 and CD81
without any uromodulin or calnexin contamination.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results imply that consid-
erable quantities of circulatory EVs are, indeed, filtered
into urine and could serve as valuable non-invasive
biomarkers for systemic dysfunctions.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small
plasma membrane-derived vesicles released from var-
ious cells, which potentially affect many physiological
and pathophysiological processes, and are emerging as
a potential novel biomarker in cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs). However, there is little information about the
association of circulating EV levels with traditional
cardiovascular risk markers and CVD risk score.
Methods: • Subjects (n = 40) aged 40–70 yrs with
moderate risk of CVDs were recruited and assessed
for body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and
plasma lipid profile (triacylglycerol, total cholesterol
and high-density lipoprotein).

• EVs were isolated from platelet-free plasma by size
exclusion
chromatography
and
analysed
by
both
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and flow cyto-
metry (FCM). NTA was used to measure the concen-
tration and size distribution of EVs population, and
EVs were phenotyped by FCM via a 3-colour panel,
which included Annexin V (for the majority of circu-
lating EVs), CD41 (for platelet-derived EVs) and
CD105 (for endothelial-derived EVs).
• The association between risk markers and EV
numbers was examined by Pearson’s correlation coeffi-
cient and stepwise multivariate regression model.
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed
after adjustment for various variables to determine
the correlation between the quartile range of EV num-
bers and 10-yr CVD risk detected by QRISK2.
Results: EV numbers, as determined by NTA, were
strongly associated with BMI (r = 0.602, p < 0.001),
blood pressure (systolic BP: r = 0.359, p = 0.023; dia-
stolic BP: r = 0.550, p < 0.001) and plasma triacylgly-
cerol levels (r = 0.703, p < 0.001). Plasma total
cholesterol level was positively associated with plate-
let-derived EVs, determined by FCM (r = 0.330,
p = 0.038). A multivariate regression model demon-
strated that plasma triacylglycerol and diastolic BP
independently
predicted
total
EV
numbers,
with
plasma
triacylglycerol
concentrations
explaining
49.4% of the variance for total EV numbers. An addi-
tional 9.3% of the variance in total EV numbers was
predicted by diastolic BP. ANCOVA of the 10-yr CVD
risk score in the quartile range of total EV numbers
were positively and independently associated.
Summary/Conclusion: BMI, blood pressure, plasma
triacylglycerol and total cholesterol levels are strongly
associated with EV numbers. Plasma triacylglycerol
and diastolic BP independently predict circulating EV
numbers. Elevated numbers of EVs are independently
associated with 10-yr CVD risk.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles from cardiosphere-
derived cells (CDC-EVs) are known to be anti-inflam-
matory in various disease models. To further dissect
the mechanism, we examined the effects of CDC-EVs
on T lymphocytes.
Methods: Naïve CD4 + T cells were isolated from
secondary lymphoid organs of Foxp3-RFP reporter
mice, using magnetic-activated and fluorescence-acti-
vated cell sorting. Cells were subsequently polarized
into effector subtypes (Th1, Th2, and Th17), as well
as regulatory T cells (Tregs), and the effects of exposure
to human-derived CDC-EVs on proliferation and cyto-
kine production were assessed. CDC-EVs were isolated
from serum-free, 15-day conditioned medium, using
ultrafiltration by centrifugation.
Results: After polarization and culture for 5 days,
CDC-EVs resulted in dose-dependent and cell-specific
proliferative responses. Effector T cells (Th1, Th2,
Th17) showed either no change in proliferation (Th1)
or decrease in proliferation (Th2, Th17), compared to
the vehicle control. In contrast, Tregs proliferated
much more than control (P < 0.0001). Next, we sought
to characterize the changes in cytokine production by
each effector T cell and Tregs. Compared to the vehicle
control, exposure of polarized effector T cells to CDC-
EVs had little effect on the expression of characteristic
cytokine genes, including Ifnγ and Tnfα (Th1), Il4 and
Il13 (Th2), or Il17a and Il17 f (Th17). In contrast,
exposure of Tregs to CDC-EVs resulted in ~1000-fold
increase in expression of Il10, a key paracrine agent
utilized by Tregs in suppression of inflammation. This
response was specific to CDC-EVs insofar as it was not
recapitulated
with
dermal
fibroblast
exosomes.
Concentrations of IL-10 in the culture media of
CDC-EV-conditioned Tregs mirrored the increases in
gene expression.
Summary/Conclusion: CDC-EVs potentiate Tregs by
increasing their proliferation and enhancing production
of IL-10. This offers an attractive therapeutic approach
to inflammatory diseases that relies on harnessing an
endogenous mechanism of immunosuppression.

Introduction: Prostanoids (epoprostenol, treprosti-
nil and iloprost) induce vasodilation in advanced
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) but also
inhibit platelet activation, thereby increasing the
risk of bleeding. Therefore, the platelet function
and extracellular vesicle (EV) concentrations were
measured in PAH patients treated with prostanoids
and compared to patients with PAH not receiving
prostanoids.
Methods: Venous blood was collected from 42 patients
treated
with
prostanoids
(study
group;
n
=
42,
50 ± 16 years, 70% female) and 38 patients not treated
with prostanoids (control group; n = 38, 55 ± 19 years,
65% female). Platelet reactivity was analysed in whole
blood by impedance aggregometry using arachidonic
acid (AA; 0.5 mM), adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 6.5
µM) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP;
32 µM) as agonists. In a subset of patients, concentra-
tions of EVs from platelets (CD61+ and CD62p+;
PEVs), leukocytes (CD45+, LEVs) and endothelial
cells (CD146+, EEVs) were measured in platelet-
depleted
plasma
by
flow
cytometry
(A60-Micro).
Platelet-rich thrombus formation was measured using
a whole blood perfusion system.
Results: Compared to the control group, patients
treated with prostanoids had lower platelet reactivity
in response to AA and ADP (p = 0.01) and lower
concentrations
of
PEVs
and
LEVs
(p
≤
0.05).
Furthermore,
thrombus
formation
was
delayed
(p
≤
0.003)
and
thrombus
size
was
decreased
(p = 0.008) on prostanoids. Epoprostenol did not
affect platelet reactivity in vitro, but decreased the
concentrations of CD61+ PEVs (p = 0.04). In con-
trast, treprostinil and iloprost decreased both platelet
reactivity in response to AA and ADP (p ≤0.05) and
the concentrations of PEVs (p ≤0.08). All prostanoids
delayed thrombus formation and decreased thrombus
size (p ≤0.04).
Summary/Conclusion: Patients with PAH treated with
prostanoids have increased risk of bleeding both due to
impaired platelet aggregation, EV release and thrombus
formation, compared to patients not treated with pros-
tanoids.

Nanoflow cytometry identifies an imbalance of epithelium- and neutro-
phil-derived extracellular vesicles in the airway environment of paediatric
cystic fibrosis patients

Introduction: Progressive lung disease is the leading
cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic
condition characterized by recruitment of polymor-
phonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into the airways.
Newly arrived PMNs are exposed to extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) from the airway epithelium and PMNs
recruited before them. In controlled experiments,
these EVs were necessary and sufficient to induce
pathological changes including reduced bacterial killing
and immunosuppressive activities towards macro-
phages and T-cells. However, children with CF do not
always show a high PMN presence in their airways,
which suggests that the balance between PMN recruit-
ment and the activity of other cells is still in flux in
early stage disease.
Methods: We utilized spectral nanoflow cytometry to
profile the single EV content of the bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) from 17 CF children (<6 years of
age). For nanoflow cytometry, EVs were stained with
Di-8-ANEPPs, and with EpCAM, CD66b and CD115
(to ascertain epithelial, PMN, and macrophage origins,
respectively). Violet side scatter and/or fluorescence
threshold triggering were used for EV detection.
Results: The ratio of neutrophil- to epithelial-derived
EVs in CF BALF correlated positively with the percen-
tage
of
PMNs

are
present

quantifies airway damage by chest computed tomogra-
phy (p = 0.001, rho = 0.857).
Summary/Conclusion: Using a method to quantify
EVs from specific cell types in vivo, we demonstrated
that the ratio of PMN- and epithelial cell-derived EVs
tracks with airway damage and neutrophil influx, sug-
gesting a critical interplay between these cells in early
CF disease. This EV-focused method can be applied to
other diseases in which sampling cells is difficult.
Future experiments will use CF BALF biobanks to

Introduction:
Circulating
cell-free
microRNAs
(miRNAs), often associated to extracellular vesicles
(EVs), are essential for cell-cell communication in the
pathogenesis of infectious pulmonary disorders. As
early pneumonia diagnosis is often clinically challen-
ging, advances in disease detection could improve out-
comes.
We
characterized
crude
EV
miRNAs
as
potential biomarkers for community-acquired pneu-
monia and sepsis as a severe secondary complication.
Methods: 142 individuals were enrolled into our study,
subdivided into a training (volunteer n = 27, pneumo-
nia n = 12, sepsis n = 28) and testing cohort (volunteer
n = 20, pneumonia n = 18, sepsis n = 37). After
precipitating
crude
EVs
from
sera
(miRCURY
Exosome Isolation Kit-Serum and Plasma) and extract-
ing total RNA, small RNA sequencing was performed.
miRNAs were selected as biomarker candidates by
differential gene expression analysis (DESeq2) and
sparse
partial-least-squares
discriminant
analysis
(mixOmics). Technical and biological validation was
performed by reverse transcription quantitative real-
time PCR. Group classification was predicted by par-
tial-least-squares discriminant analysis. Gene targets
and causal networks were identified by ingenuity path-
way analysis.
Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed
29 significantly regulated miRNAs in pneumonia com-
pared to volunteers, and 25 miRNAs in pneumonia
related to sepsis. Based on sparse-partial least discrimi-
nant analysis, group separation was achieved by 12
miRNAs as discriminators with high sensitivity and
specificity (area under the curve of the receiver oper-
ated curve: volunteer: 0.982, pneumonia: 0.965, sepsis:
0.992). miR-193a-5p (log2FC = 1.86, padj = 1.49E-6)
and miR-542-3p (log2FC = 1.67, padj = 3.29E-5) dif-
ferentiated between pneumonia and volunteers and
miR-1246 (log2FC = −2.41, padj = 1.78E-04) between
pneumonia and sepsis. Expression levels of miR-193a-
5p and miR-1246 were related to disease severity. miR-
542-3p was higher expressed in pneumonia compared
to volunteers and had equal expression in patient
groups. Prediction of group classification in the testing
cohort was 73.33%. Signalling networks were con-
structed for “cellular and humoral immune response”,
“antimicrobial response” and “pathogen influenced sig-
naling” involving the significantly regulated miRNAs.
Summary/Conclusion: Crude EV miRNAs are poten-
tially novel biomarkers for community-acquired pneu-
monia and may help to identify patients at risk for
progress to sepsis allowing early intervention and
treatment.

their miRNA cargo play an important role in the proin-
flammatory status of the upper airway of asthma
patients, especially in those patients with severe asthma.
Methods:
In
a
pilot
study,3healthy
subjects
had
induced sputum using standard methods. After several
centrifugation steps, we were able to isolate exosomes
from sputum supernatant by both precipitation and
Size Exclusion Cromatography (SEC). Exosome size
was observed with Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) and the protein markers CD63 and CD81 were
analysed by Western Blot (WB). Then, total RNAs
were isolated from sputum exosomes and 9 miRNAs
(miR-103a-p, miR-191-5p, miR-320a, miR-200b-3p,
miR-185-5p,
miR-223-3p,
miR-21-5p,
miR-155-5p,
let-7 g-5p), were evaluated by RT-qPCR. After the
optimization of the methodology, 10 healthy adults
subjects and 10 patients with persistent moderate-
severe asthma, matched by age and sex were selected
and induced sputum was collected.
Results: Exosomes isolated with both methodologies
(precipitation and SEC) were observe under the TEM
with a correct range of size. Furthermore, WB assay
displayed a coherent protein profile for the exosome
markers CD63 and CD81. However, SEC displayed
low signal and the variability of between subjects was
to higher. Using the optimized method of precipitation,
we observed that after normalization, miRNA-320a
showed a significant increased (p = 0.02) in asthma
patients compared to control. This miRNA has been
linked with an active proinflammatory status.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results confirm the pre-
sence of exosomes in induced sputum with promising
applications in the field of asthma. The upregulation of
exosomal miR-320a, which is related with inflamma-
tion, suggest that exosomes could play a crucial role in
the chronic inflammation of airway described in
asthma patients.

Introduction: Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) have
attracted much attention for their capacity to accelerate
wound healing. Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesi-
cles, may be key to translating MSC therapy. We pre-
viously found that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates MSC promotion of diabetic
tissue repair. Here, we explore a novel role of Nrf2 in
exosome biogenesis and investigate whether exosome
treatment recapitulates the effects MSCs have on
healing.
Methods: Exosomes were harvested by differential
ultracentrifugation
of
conditioned
bone
marrow
derived MSC media. For Nrf2-active exosomes, MSCs
were incubated with potent Nrf2 activator, CDDO-Im.
Exosomes and MSCs were vigorously characterized.
Full-thickness humanized-stented wounds were created
on adult Leprdb/db diabetic mice (db/db). Exosomes
were injected intradermally and circumferentially to
the wound margin.
Results: MSCs adopt an adherent fibroblast morphol-
ogy, demonstrate robust osteogenic, chondrogenic, and
adipogenic differentiation, express >95% positive MSC
markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105) and <5%
express negative markers (CD45, CD31, CD14, CD19,
or HLA-DR). Immunoblotting of MSC exosomes
shows enrichment for positive exosomal markers
CD81, CD9 and TSG101. Nanoparticle tracking analy-
sis (NTA) shows a nanoparticle population with mean
diameter of 168.0 ± 6.5nm. Transmission electron
microscopy of exosomes reveals flattened cup-like
spheres. NTA demonstrates that Nrf2-active human
MSCs increase exosome secretion by 54%, compared
to Nrf2-baseline MSCs (p < 0.05). Both Nrf2-baseline
and
Nrf2-active
exosome
treatment
significantly
reduced closure time to 15.5 and 14 days respectively,
compared to 29.8 days for vehicle-treated wounds
(p < 0.05). This reduction eliminated the delay in
closure time compared to wounds of C57/B6 mice.
Nrf2-active
exosome
treatment
of
db/db
wounds
reduced closure time by a further 2.6 days compared
to untreated C57/B6 wounds. At day 10, exosome-
treated db/db wounds have significant decreases in
epithelial gap, expanded granulation tissue, and greater
density of CD31+ vessels compared to vehicle-treated
wounds.
Summary/Conclusion: Enhancing Nrf2 function in
MSCs multiplies exosome yield. Our results demon-
strate exosome-based therapies hold tremendous pro-
mise and warrant further investigation for rapid
translation.

humans share miRNA cargos and increase prostate cancer aggressiveness
in conjunction with Twist1

Introduction: Obesity increases prostate cancer aggres-
siveness and adipose tissue (AT) is a rich source of
extracellular vesicles (EV) that have been shown to
contribute to pro-oncogenic effects in various malig-
nancies. Twist1 is a key mediator of tumour cell metas-
tasis.. The goal of this study was to determine
molecular and phenotypic changes of prostate cancer
cells in response to EVs from obese human AT and the
role of different levels of endogenous Twist1.
Methods: EV were harvested from human AT (ATEV)
obtained from bariatric subjects or from AT endothe-
lial cells treated with proinflammatory cytokines (PIC-
EV) to mimic the obese AT environment. EVs were
isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized by
electron microscopy, NTA and protein markers. We
determined the effect of ATEV and PIC-EV on PC3-
ML prostate cancer cells proliferation and invasion. EV
miRNA cargo and transcriptome of PC3-ML cells trea-
ted with ATEV or PIC-EV were assessed using
NanoString. To establish the contribution of Twist to
the EV-related phenotypic and molecular changes in
recipient cells, we used PC3-ML lines stably overex-
pressing or deficient in Twist1.
Results: ATEV from obese subjects and EV-PIC from
AT
endothelial
cells
both
reduced
invasion
and
increased proliferation in wild-type PC3-ML cells. A
molecular signature showing decreased expression of
genes mediating invasion, adhesion and metabolism
supported these functional effects. Also ATEV and
EV-PIC shared a subset of miRNA that target multiple
MMPs, inhibit glycolytic genes and target cell cycle
inhibitory
genes.
PC3-ML
overexpressing
Twist1
showed an increase in both proliferation and invasive-
ness and this phenotype was supported by the tran-
scriptomic analysis following EV treatment.
Summary/Conclusion: EV produced by obese AT or
by AT endothelial cells share a subset of miRNA that in
conjunction with increased Twist1 expression contri-
bute to tumorigenesis and metastasis of prostate cancer
cells in vitro.

Introduction: As researchers continue to explore the
therapeutic potentials of extracellular vesicles (EVs) for
the treatment of many diseases, there is a growing
unmet need for real-time in vivo monitoring of these
therapeutic EVs after they are injected into a subject to
understand their safety, targeting, and effectiveness.
While current optical imaging solutions like biolumi-
nescence and fluorescence are useful for EV tracking
studies in animal models, there is limited utility in
clinical applications. Here we present a novel EV track-
ing
solution
utilizing
clinically
applicable
MRI
technology.
Methods: To generate trackable EVs, cells were labelled
with a clinically applicable novel magnetic agent. EVs
secreted by the labelled neural stem cells and amniotic
fluid stem cells (AFSCs) were isolated by differential
ultracentrifugation. The viability and morphology of
labelled-cells were evaluated, and the in vitro MR prop-
erties of their derived EVs were analysed by magnet-
ometer. A proof of concept in vivo biodistribution
study was conducted by injecting labelled EVs into
WT and Alport mice (a model of chronic kidney dis-
ease) via retro-orbital and intra-cardiac routes and
tracking them via MRI at 10 min and 3 hr post-
injection.
Results: The magnetic label did not affect the physio-
logical characteristics of the cells. The MR detectability
of labelled-EVs was confirmed by in vitro/ex vivo MRI
phantoms. MRI studies showed that homing of AFSC
EVs to the kidney injected intra-cardiacally into Alport
mice were more efficient versus the retro-orbital route,
and Prussian blue staining of kidney sections con-
firmed the MR findings.
Summary/Conclusion: We have developed a clinically
applicable novel magnetic nanoparticle agent that can
be used to label and track the biodistribution of EVs in
living subjects using non-invasive, safe, and effective
MRI technology that’s widely available. This technol-
ogy is highly adaptable and can be deployed in both
preclinical and clinical settings.

Introduction: A central question in EV biology is the
fate of circulating EV. This can be evaluated by devel-
oping non-invasive EV bioimaging techniques in mice
in order to benefit from transgenic and knock-out
models. Recent reports described EV biodistribution
in vivo using optical (fluorescence) and nuclear ima-
ging. But the physicochemical properties of the probes
impact EV integrity, labelling efficiency, background
signals and observation timecourse.
Methods: We developed the radiolabeling of red blood
cells (RBC) and EV with [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose
(18 F-FDG). We used RBC-derived EV in their native,
intact form, without pre-experimental processing (no
centrifugation or filtration). We tracked 18 F-FDG in
vivo by PET-Scan, within seconds of EV, RBC or free

18 F-FDG injection, and during their dissemination in
blood and recruitment by organs over one hour. EV
and RBC biodistribution were confronted to the
kinetics of free 18 F-FDG.
Results: We collected images of the biodistribution of
RBC, and RBC-derived EV. Nuclear imaging was well
suited for accurate studies of EV organotropism, with
high sensitivity, excellent signal-to-noise ratio, very low
signal absorption by tissues and an inherent quantita-
tive tomographic nature. EV-specific signals were
mostly accumulated within minutes of injection (tail
vein), in the spleen and liver, with a small part in the
bone marrow (femurs). Signals in other compartments
were largely transient and linked to tissue perfusion
and blood volume. We selected the most drastic con-
trol conditions to secure a correct interpretation of the
data. This made kidneys, hearts and brains unavailable
for analysis. Hence the new approach came with lim-
itations, but we describe how “free” 18 F-FDG signals
can be used to draw sound conclusions for EV.
Summary/Conclusion: We propose that three types of
compartments coexist in control mice at rest: Active
EV-capturing organs with high capacity and specificity
including the spleen, and to a lesser degree the bone
marrow; Passive EV-retaining organs with high capa-
city, including the liver; and EV-neutral organs where
transient signals only mirror tissue perfusion. We also
report how EV biodistribution patterns are altered in
ageing animals, as an example. We hope that this
novel,
non-invasive,
quantitative,
dynamic
whole-
body imaging approach will help characterize native
cell-derived EV and help set standards for the repro-
ducibility of EV bioimaging in mice.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are important
mediators of intercellular communication; however,
basic principles of EV biogenesis and loading remain
largely unknown. A limited repertoire of tools has thus
far made these processes challenging to research. The
development of an EV-transfer reporter in a genetically
tractable organism such as Drosophila has allowed us
to study mechanisms of cargo loading in vivo and has
provided us with a platform to explore fundamental
aspects of EV biology.
Methods: We have developed a bioinformatic pipeline to
analyse the properties embedded in the 3ʹUTR of mRNAs
enriched in EVs released by Drosophila cells. In parallel,
we have adapted a Cre-LoxP system for use in fruit flies
that appears to be proficient to reveal the exchange of
bioactive molecules between secretory and recipient cells.
Results: Taking advantage of computational methods,
we uncovered sequence motifs that preferentially
appear in combinations along the 3ʹUTR. These
sequence motifs occur within characteristic secondary
structures, in a way that is more variable and motif
dependent than previously reported. Identified motifs
also show similarities to known binding sites for RNA
binding proteins; a feature potentially important for
EV-loading. In parallel, we developed a Drosophila in
vivo system to detect cell communication in complex
tissues and between different cell types. Using this
system, we studied the biological significance of speci-
fic sequence motifs and identified their ability to mod-
ulate mRNA EV-transfer in a context dependent and
evolutionarily conserved manner.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, we have devel-
oped a novel tool to study cell communication in
complex tissues, and shown its effectiveness to study
principles of EV biogenesis and loading. Beyond
improving our understanding of EV biology and pro-
viding a novel tool to the scientific community, we
hope this knowledge will pave the way to harnessing
EVs as a means of remotely manipulating cell commu-
nication in many biological contexts.

extracellular

is
a
recent
avenue.
However, the bioactivity and bioavailability of these
dietary
compounds
upon
consumption
is
highly
debated. It has been proposed that EVs from diet can
absorbed by consuming organisms, be bioavailable in
various organs and exert phenotypic changes. Milk is
the most vastly consumed beverage and is an abundant
source of EVs that may act as signalosomes. Whether
these milk-derived EVs can serve as cross-species mes-
sengers and have a biological effect on host organism
has been poorly understood.
Methods: Bovine milk-derived EVs were isolated by
ultracentrifugation and OptiPrep density gradient cen-
trifugation. The EVs were characterised by TEM, NTA,
quantitative proteomics and RNA-Seq. EVs were orally
administered to various mice models of colorectal,
breast and pancreatic cancer. Primary tumour burden
was monitored, and the rate of metastases was mea-
sured by imaging and qPCR. Immune cells were ana-
lysed by FACS. Mechanistic insights were obtained
using quantitative proteomics, confocal microscopy
and biochemical experiments.
Results: We demonstrated that upon oral administra-
tion, bovine milk-derived EVs were able to survive the
harsh degrading conditions of the gut and be bioavail-
able in peripheral tissues. Interestingly, oral adminis-
tration of milk-derived EVs reduced the primary
tumour burden in various cancer models and attenu-
ated cancer cachexia. Intriguingly, despite the reduc-
tion in primary tumour growth, milk-derived EVs
accelerated metastasis in breast and pancreatic cancer
mice models. Timing of EV administration was critical
as oral administration after resection of the primary
tumour reversed the pro-metastatic effects of milk-
derived EVs in breast cancer. Biochemical and quanti-
tative proteomics analysis highlighted the induction of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and senescence
upon treatment with milk-derived EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, we were able
to demonstrate the capacity of bovine milk-derived
EVs in mediating cross-species communication and
regulating cancer progression in a context-dependent
manner.

Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) – a bacterial innate defence system
against viral infection
Xiaomei Yan, Qian Niu and Ye Tian
Xiamen University, Xiamen, China (People’s Republic)
Introduction:
In
order
to
survive
the
constant
onslaught of phage, bacteria have evolved diverse
defence mechanisms that act at every stage of the
phage life cycle. It has been suggested that bacterial
membrane vesicles (MVs) may play a key role in
innate bacterial defence against phage infection by
acting as a decoy to prevent phage adsorption.
Nearly a decade has passed since MVs were first
proposed as a decoy, but details of how bacteria utilize
MVs to defend against phages remain poorly under-
stood. Here we use the laboratory-built nano-flow
cytometer (nFCM) to reveal details of the interaction
between MVs and phages at the single-particle level,
and to provide new insights into innate defence
mechanisms of MVs.
Methods: S. Typhimurium was used as the model
system. Differential ultracentrifugation and density
gradient centrifugation were used to isolate and purify
MVs and bacteriophage P22. Cryo-TEM was used to
determine the morphologies of MVs and phage P22.
The purity of MV isolates was validated by measuring
the particle concentration before and after Triton X-
100 treatment. Monodisperse silica nanoparticles were
used as the size reference standards to measure the size
distribution of MVs via single-particle light scattering
detection. The purity of phage P22 was verified by
concurrent detection of side scatter and fluorescence
signals of single phages upon nucleic acid staining by
SYTO 82.
Results: By incubating MVs and AF532-labelled P22,
the number of phages adsorbed on single MVs were
accurately quantified. We found that S. Typhimurium
and MVs it secretes express different affinity for
phage P22 attachment. The binding ability of P22 to
MVs is greater than that of bacteria. We confirmed
that P22 can inject their nucleic acids into MVs, and
these nucleic acids can be degraded by non-specific
nucleases inside MVs for the first time. Besides, by
labelling the nucleic acids of MVs with SYTO 82, we
were able to distinguish three different subpopula-
tions of MVs.
Summary/Conclusion:
Taking
advantage
of
the
superior sensitivity of nFCM in single-particle ana-
lysis, we developed a novel approach to the charac-
terization of the interaction between MVs and
phages. Our study revealed that bacteria produce
MVs as bait to attract viral adsorption and nucleic
acids injection.

Introduction: The development of EVs for therapeutic
applications requires an in-depth understanding of
their in vivo biodistribution and pharmacokinetic pro-
file. In this study, we have made a comprehensive
comparison of nuclear, fluorescent, and bioluminescent
imaging technologies to identify the most suitable in
vivo EV tracking method.
Methods: EVs were purified from Expi293 F cell super-
natant by differential centrifugation followed by iodix-
anol
density
gradient
separation
and
further
characterized following MISEV guidelines. Engineered
Expi293 F cells were used to generate EVs carrying
mCherry or NanoLuc (Nluc) proteins. The membrane
of naïve EV was labelled with Indium111(In111)-DTPA
or Xenolight DiR post-EV isolation. CT26 tumour-bear-
ing
BALB/c
mice
were intravenously
dosed
with
1 × 1011 EVs followed by imaging at 1 h, 4h and 24h
using SPEC/CT and IVIS systems. Tissue distribution
and blood circulation profile of EVs were analysed from
ex vivo samples up to 24h post-injection.
Results: Xenolight DiR and (In111)-DTPA were the
most suitable EV labels for live whole-body animal
imaging, ex vivo organ imaging, and tissue lysate
quantification. Nluc was appropriate for ex vivo
imaging and tissue lysates quantification, but sub-
optimal for live imaging with limited sensitivity.
mCherry EVs were found not suitable for in vivo
tracking studies due to high background signal
fluorescence.
Ex
vivo
organ
quantification
of
In111-DTPA
and
DiR
showed
that
naïve
EVs
mainly accumulate in liver, followed by spleen, kid-
neys, and lungs at 24h post-dose, with less than 5%
EV exposure to the tumours. Interestingly, Nluc-
EVs accumulated mainly in the lungs, regardless of
the small size of the particles injected and the
absence of aggregation. Blood circulation profile of
In111-DTPA and Nluc EVs showed rapid clearance
of vesicles from circulation, with 15% of injected
dose detected in blood after 30 min and less than
5% after 16 h.
Summary/Conclusion: Radionuclide imaging is an
excellent technology to detect EVs in vivo and ex
vivo with high resolution and sensitivity but requires
advanced infrastructure for radiolabeling. The opti-
cal methods have limited tissue penetration and sen-
sitivity but can be improved with the right selection
of the dye. These results contribute to the under-
standing of the biodistribution and pharmacoki-
netics of EVs and are highly relevant to exploiting
their potential for targeted delivery to diseased tis-
sues in vivo.

Introduction: New methods for quantifying extracellular
vesicles (EVs) in complex biofluids are critically needed.
We report the development of a new technology combin-
ing size exclusion chromatography (SEC), a commonly
used EV purification technique, with fluorescence detec-
tion of specifically labelled EVs (Flu-SEC).
Methods: Flu-SEC was validated using red blood cell
derived EVs (REVs). Size and concentration measure-
ments were performed by microfluidic resistive pulse
sensing
(MRPS)
using
the
nCS1
instrument
(Spectradyne
LLC,
USA).
PE-CD235a
(anti-
Glycophorin A) and Alexa647-WGA (wheat germ
agglutinin) were used to label REVs. Flu-SEC experi-
ments were performed on a liquid chromatography
system using a Tricorn 5/200 glass column filled with
Sepharose CL-2B gel (GE Healthcare).
Results: A log-normal size distribution was obtained for
REVs with a mean diameter of 163.5 ± 0.7 nm and
standard deviation of 30.6 ± 0.6 nm. The concentration
of REVs measured by MRPS was 3.14*10E11 particles/
mL. The fluorescence chromatograms of the REV sam-
ples labelled with PE-CD235a and with Alexa647-WGA
show the typical features of the separation of EVs from
soluble proteins with SEC and enables the determination
of the labelling efficiency of the markers. The linear range
for quantification of EVs in our experiments spans over
two orders of magnitude ranging from 10E9 particles/mL
to 10E11 particles/mL. The LOD depends on the type of
the label. In our experiments the lowest LOD was 10E9
particles/mL for Alexa647-WGA.
Summary/Conclusion: The results indicate that Flu-
SEC is a quantitative technique with very good linearity
over a wide range of concentrations, though the limit
of detection depends largely on the employed label (Sci.
Rep. 9, 19868, 2019). Moreover, the ratio of EV-bound
and free-antibody molecules can be also determined by
Flu-SEC, which can be used to calculate the labelling
efficiency of the used marker.

(EVs). Control over such properties is constantly
experienced by researchers to be critical for EV proper
manipulation, engineering and translation. However,
the need for characterization methods that strike the
balance between robustness, working volume, cost and
accessibility remains unmet.
Methods: The COlorimetric NANoplasmonic (CONAN)
assay we developed consists of a solution of gold nano-
particles (AuNPs) into which 1–2 μL of the EV formula-
tion is added. The solution turns blue if the formulation
is pure, while stays red if soluble exogenous single and
aggregated proteins (SAPs) are present. The colour shift is
visible by the naked eye and can be quantified by con-
ventional UV-Vis spectroscopy, providing a quantitative
index of purity and an estimation the EV molar concen-
tration (particle number).
Results: The assay specifically targets SAPs, and not the
EV-related proteins, with a detection limit < 50 ng/μL
(an order of magnitude higher resolution than the
Bradford protein assay). For pure solutions, the assay
also allows for determining the EV number, as the
colour shift is linearly dependent to the AuNP/EV
molar ratio. Instead, it automatically reports if the
solution bears SAP contaminants, thus avoiding count-
ing artefacts. Experiments, conducted on EV separated
from Milk and Ascaris Suum culture medium, are
repeatable, with an error below 20%.
Summary/Conclusion: CONAN proves to be robust
and reliable, while displaying appealing performances
in terms of cost (inexpensive reagents, run by standard
microplate reader), working volumes (1–2 μL) and
time (the procedure takes less than one hour). The
ability to assign a quantitative purity grade is, up to
date, a unique peculiarity of this assay. Finally, the
assay is potentially extendable to all classes of natural
and artificial lipid micro- and nanoparticles.

Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) present
fairly distinctive lipid membrane features in the extra-
cellular environment. These include high curvature,
lipid packing defects and a relative abundance in lipids
such as phosphatidylserine and ceramide. sEV mem-
brane could be then considered as a “universal” mar-
ker,
alternative
or
complementary
to
traditional
characteristic surface-associated proteins.
Here we introduce the use of membrane sensing
peptides as new, highly efficient ligands to directly
integrate sEV capturing and analysis on a microarray
platform.
Methods: We designed and synthesized membrane-
sensing peptide ligands as molecular baits for small
EV and we demonstrate their use in a microarray plat-
form as valuable alternative/complement to antibodies.
EVs from blood serum and plasma were isolated by
ultracentrifugation, characterized by TEM, NTA, WB.
Samples were analysed by label-free, single particle
counting and sizing on peptide microarrays coupled
to fluorescence co-localization immune staining with
fluorescent anti-CD9/anti-CD63/anti-CD81antibodies.
Results: Peptide microarrays were realized using a
click-chemistry strategy for optimal peptide surface
orientation and used to analyse EVs from human
blood. Membrane sensing peptides showed a capturing
capacity higher than anti-tetraspanin antibodies. In
addition to purified vesicles, peptide ligands were
tested with pure serum showing capacity to capture
EVs even from complex samples. In order to get
insights into the EV-peptide binding mechanism and
verify whether it is directly mediated by the lipid
membrane, trypsin-treated EVs were captured on pep-
tide microarrays demonstrating that binding is not
directly mediated by surface associated proteins.
Summary/Conclusion: We introduced the use of mem-
brane sensing peptides as a novel class of molecular
ligands for integrated sEV isolation and analysis, report-
ing for the first time on peptide microarrays for extra-
cellular vesicles. Given their affinity to the membrane of
small EV, these molecules can serve as general baits,
enabling vesicles capturing unbiased by differential sur-
face protein expression. These new class of molecular
probes may be integrated with the use of protein markers
towards improved small EV isolation and characteriza-
tion. Compared to proteins and antibodies, peptides are
characterized by low cost of preparation, remarkable
stability and ease of chemical manipulation, offering vir-
tually unlimited possibilities for experimental design. We
anticipate that this new class of ligands, may greatly
enrich the molecular toolbox for EV analysis.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been
found to mediate intercellular communication in phy-
siological and pathological processes. Nevertheless, the
understanding of EVs bio-functionality remains elu-
sive, mainly because of their high heterogeneity in
molecular content, but also in size (30–2000 nm).
Therefore, accurate size measurements of EVs are
highly desired, particularly for exploiting their full
diagnostic/therapeutic potential.
Currently available techniques, such as Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis (NTA), cannot accurately measure
EVs smaller than 70 nm and are not capable to distin-
guish them from protein aggregates. On the contrary,
electron microscopy (EM) techniques allow high-reso-
lution size-profiling and morphological analysis of EVs
over their whole size range. However, their low
throughput combined with several long preparatory
steps have prevented EM from being routinely used
for EV size profiling.
Methods: We shall present a method improvement in
throughput and reproducibility of EV size-analysis by
scanning EM (SEM). The technique is based on cova-
lent EV capture onto a silicon wafer, using the protocol
reported by Cavallaro et al. up to the Glutaraldehyde
step.
After
immobilization,
Critical
Point
Drying
(CPD) is performed to dehydrate EVs before SEM,
while preserving their shapes.
Results: SEM images, showing the comparison in den-
sities of EVs prepared by covalent and non-covalent
coupling to substrate, indicated a good capture effi-
ciency of our covalent protocol. The size distribution
analysis showed good agreement between NTA and
SEM for EVs >80 nm. For smaller EVs, SEM is more
sensitive than NTA, thus more suitable to check the
purity of EV-isolation techniques. Last, atomic-force
microscopy (AFM) measurements was also used to
validate our measurements.
Summary/Conclusion: To conclude, SEM can be
used to accurately estimate EV size distributions in a
wide range, overcoming the well-known limitations
of NTA.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mem-
brane vesicles secreted into extracellular space, by
almost all cellular populations, playing a major role in
cell-to-cell communication. It has been already demon-
strated that changes in luminal or surface protein car-
gos of these vesicles, may reflect the status of producing
cells. For this reason, EVs are considered as potential
biomarkers in several types of diseases ranging from
cancer diagnosis to heart rejection.
Periostin (POSTN) is a matricellular protein asso-
ciated with EVs, and its level is considered a possible
biomarker, which indicate malignancy and poor clin-
ical outcome in different types of cancer.
Here we extensively characterize the presence of
POSTN associated on EVs, showing how different iso-
lation methods can drastically affect the amount of
POSTN content in extracellular vesicles fraction.
Methods: Serial ultracentrifugation steps or size exclu-
sion chromatography were used to isolate EVs from
primary culture of cardiac progenitor cells. EVs were
characterize,
according
to
MISEV
guidelines,
by
Western Blot, NTA, FACS and CryoTEM analysis
methods. POSTN amount, associated with EVs, was
analyses by Western Blot and ELISA. Furthermore,
functional tests were performed on H9C2 cardiomyo-
blast cell line, treated with the same amount of EVs
from different isolation methods; cells response were
analysed by Western Blot.
Results: EVs, from both the isolation methods, showed
TSG101, Syntenin1, CD63 positivity while GRP94 was
absent. NTA showed no differences, in terms of
amount and size of particles. By FACS analysis EVs
resulted
enriched
with
CD63,
CD9
and
CD81.
CryoTEM showed a similar morphology in the two
preparations with presence of protein contaminant in
the ultracentrifuge pellet. In vitro, H9C2 treated with
EVs showed activation of pFAK after 10ʹ of treatment,

this induction was 1.5 times higher in cells treated with
EVs isolated with ultracentrifuge compared to EVs
isolated with SEC, confirming a drastic effect of
POSTN
protein
contamination.
Furthermore,
by
Phospholipase-C treatment, we found that POSTN is
bound to EVs surface through a GPI anchor.
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest that selec-
tion of a proper isolation method is critically relevant
in EVs studies, in particular when protein analysis is
considered. Different isolation methods dramatically
influence protein amount in extracellular vesicles and
consequentially their function. Furthermore, in this
study we show for the first time, that POSTN is actually
bound to EVs surface and not carried in their lumen as
previously believed.

Extracellular vesicles – a tattletale for rare gene editing events

Introduction: Since its discovery, gene editing has
provided the ability to meticulously change genes
with a profound effect on both therapeutics and mole-
cular research. Even with new tools constantly being
developed to increase efficiency and precision of the
technique, the repair mechanisms post-gene editing are
still error prone making it critical to detect and/or
select a desired gene-corrected cell clone. Since the
contents of extracellular vesicles (EVs) reflect the cells
that produced them, if a gene editing event occurs, the
EV cargo should contain the gene corrected products,
such as a protein or RNA species. The catch lays in the
fact that EVs are by their nature very heterogeneous
and only a small fraction of the population may har-
bour the gene edited products.
Methods: We designed a CD63 construct with a geno-
mic DNA target sequence for detection of a desired
gene editing event. The gene editing target harbours a
premature stop codon. Only when the desired gene
editing event occurs to correct stop codon truncations
by genomic missense or frameshift mutations, is a
bioluminescent signal detected, as it then allows the
CD63 tethered luciferase reporter to be translated.
Results: This reporter detects gene corrections 2 days
post-introduction of Cas9 and a sgRNA targeting the
stop codon. Next-Generation Sequencing confirmed
that the signal resulted from 1.12% gDNA changes.
Our observations highlight the sensitivity of our system
to detect even highly inefficient non-homologous end
joining repair after a double-strand break within the
target DNA. The CD63 construct also contains a mem-
brane surface immune affinity tag to facilitate isolation
of cells that encode the full length reporter, excluding
the non-gene edited cells, without the need for single
cell FACS. Moreover, the latter tag enables isolation of
a pure EV population from these corrected cells to be
isolated in a 1–2 hr procedure from the cell media.
These EVs are detectable with luminescence if the
reporter is fully expressed in the target cells. Our data
shows that with this construct, EVs can be selected out
of a heterogeneous pool of EVs that contain RNA
solely expressed in the corrected cell. The latter obser-
vation allows the EVs derived from corrected cells to
report on RNA derived from CRISPR/Cas9 events
without the need for cell lysis and gene sequencing.
Summary/Conclusion: A CD63 transgenic reporter
protein contained in the membrane of cells and EVs
may be used to detect and select out correctly gene
edited EV-donor cells early on, reducing effort in
avoiding cells with off targets effects.

Introduction: Major efforts are made to identify
changes in the microRNA (miRNA) and messenger
RNA content of patient plasma to discover novel dis-
ease-associated biomarkers. MiRNA in plasma can be
associated to various macromolecular structures, includ-
ing extracellular vesicles (EV), lipoprotein particles
(LPP) and ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP). Besides
miRNA, plasma contains various other non-coding
RNA species, of which some are contained in EV.
Members of the Y-RNA family have been detected in
EV from various cell types and are among the most
abundant non-coding RNA types in plasma. We pre-
viously showed that shuttling of full-length Y-RNA into
EV is modulated by TLR-activation of EV-producing
immune cells. This suggested that Y-RNAs may have
potential as biomarker for immune-related diseases.
Methods: We separated RNA-containing structures in
plasma based on differences in size, density, and resis-
tance to protease/RNase treatment. Using RT-qPCR,
we quantified full-length Y-RNA subtypes (Y1, Y3,
Y4) in EV from various blood-related cell types cul-
tured with or without LPS-stimulation. Inflammation-
induced changes in Y-RNA were assessed in plasma
samples from a human endotoxemia study.
Results: Full-length Y-RNA in plasma was mainly
found in EV (early SEC-fractions, density 1.11–1.18
g/ml).
In
contrast,
specific
miRNAs
were
either
enriched in LPP (e.g. miR-122), in both EV and LPP
(e.g. miR-16 and miR-21), or in EV (e.g. miR-150). EV-
enclosed full-length Y-RNA was resistant to enzymatic
degradation, while LPP-bound miRNAs were degrada-
tion sensitive. We discovered that EV released by dif-
ferent blood cell types varied in Y-RNA subtype ratios.
These ratios remained stable upon LPS-stimulation of
the EV-producing cells. In endotoxemia plasma sam-
ples, the neutrophil-specific Y4/Y3 ratios and PBMC-
specific Y3/Y1 ratios changed significantly during sys-
temic inflammation. Importantly, the plasma Y-RNA
ratios strongly correlated with the number and type of
circulating immune cells during the inflammation
process.
Summary/Conclusion: Cell type specific “Y-RNA sig-
natures” in plasma EV can be determined without
prior EV-enrichment, and may be further explored as
biomarkers to diagnose inflammatory responses or
other immune-related diseases.

Munich, Freising, Germany, Freising, Germany; bDept. Biomolecular Health

Introduction: Although recent endeavours such as EV-
TRACK or the MISEV guidelines have made real head-
way in the continuing effort of improved characteriza-
tion and standardization of extracellular vesicles (EV)
methodologies, comparability between EV studies is
still hampered by the multitude of experimental setups
scientists can choose from. Different biological con-
texts or EV isolation methods will likely yield distinct
miRNA
profiles,
which
makes
choosing
suitable
miRNAs as references or as potential biomarkers
from literature difficult at best. At the same time,
repositories for RNA-seq data harbour a wealth of
EV-related data, which can be utilized in creating a
comprehensive miRNA overview to detect influences
of these different experimental procedures or disease
contexts.
Methods: Recent literature as well as publicly available
data bases (e.g. SRA, ENA, GEO) were searched for
EV-related Small RNA-Seq data sets comprising a large
variety of different species, tissues and diseases. Raw
RNA-Seq data was processed to exclude poor quality
data and reads mapping to other RNA species (e.g.
rRNA, tRNA) before generating standardized miRNA
read counts. To account for variable analysis setups,
count lists were normalized by 6 commonly used nor-
malization methods for abundance analyses and poten-
tial,
stably
expressed
reference
transcripts
were
evaluated
by
3
different
established
algorithms
(geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder).
Results: miRNA abundances and potential miRNA
references are made available in an easy-to-use web
tool (http://141.40.217.80:3838/miREV/). In a first big
feasibility study, 654 data sets focusing on blood
derived EVs were implemented. After strict filtering,
407 data sets (of 654) and 326 candidate miRNAs (of
2632) remained. Applying normalization methods and
stability algorithms, 3 miRNAs turned out to be the
most stable in blood derived EVs: miR-30d-5p, miR-
140-5p, miR-23a-3p. In the near future, another 1,200
datasets from over 40 published EV studies will be
implemented to further validate miREV applicability.
Results can be refined by the user by filtering for,
amongst others, specific disease/treatment context, tis-
sues of origin or isolation methods to match individual
experimental setups as close as possible. All findings
(normalized read counts as well as potential reference
transcripts)
are

Summary/Conclusion: miREV represents a new and
comprehensive tool for scientists working in EV tran-
scriptomics. By summarizing publicly available small
RNA-seq data sets, it assists in finding suitable
miRNAs as qPCR references or for biomarker research
without the need to run prior RNA-seq yourself. In the
future, the miREV framework can be easily expanded
to include data from further species or experimental
setups.

Presence of vault RNA and proteins indicates contamination of extracel-
lular vesicle preparations with vault particles
Xinming Liu, Daniel Lambert and Stuart Hunt
The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain a
variety of molecular cargo such as proteins and nucleic
acids. Vault particle components (vtRNA and proteins)
have been repeatedly reported in the literature as part
of the EV cargo. Here, we assessed the presence of vault
particle components in EVs prepared by commonly
used isolation methods to determine whether they
were bona fide EV cargo.
Methods: EVs were isolated by differential centrifuga-
tion,
size
exclusion
chromatography
(SEC)
and
Dynabead immunocapture. Preparations were charac-
terised by TEM, NTA, and western blotting for EV
markers. Abundance of vtRNAs was determined by
small RNA sequencing and qPCR. Major vault protein
(MVP) abundance was determined by western blotting.
RNase and proteinase K protection assays were used to
investigate whether vault components were protected
by EV membranes.
Results: EVs isolated by all methods were positive for
EV markers, such as CD63, CD9 and TSG101. VtRNAs
and MVP co-purified with EV markers by differential
centrifugation and SEC. RNase and protease treatment
of EV preparations demonstrated that vtRNA and
MVP were not protected within the EV membrane.
Immunocapture of EVs already pelleted by ultracentri-
fugation showed co-purification of MVP. Whereas,
EVs captured directly from conditioned medium were
not MVP-positive.
Summary/Conclusion: Commonly used isolation tech-
niques, such as differential centrifugation and SEC, can
lead to contamination of EVs with vault particle com-
ponents. The current study highlights the importance
of following the MISEV2018 guidelines when deter-
mining the topology of EV-associated components, or
if indeed they are EV cargo or contaminants that have
been co-purifed.

Staphylococcus aureus secrete immunomodulatory RNA and DNA via
extracellular vesicles
Blanca V. Rodriguez and Meta Kuehn
Duke University, Durham, USA
Introduction: Bacterial-derived RNA and DNA can
function as ligands for intracellular receptor activation
and induce downstream signalling to modulate the
host response to bacterial infection. The mechanisms
underlying the secretion of immunomodulatory RNA
and DNA by human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus
aureus, and their delivery to intracellular host cell
receptors is not well understood. Recently, extracellular
membrane vesicle (MV) production has been proposed
as a general secretion mechanism that could facilitate
the delivery of functional bacterial nucleic acids into
host cells. S. aureus produce membrane-bound, sphe-
rical, nano-sized, MVs packaged with a select array of
bioactive macromolecules and they have been shown to
play important roles in bacterial virulence and in
immune modulation through the transmission of bio-
logic signals to host cells. The present study sought to
examine the nature of the association between nucleic
acids and MVs produced by S. aureus. We also sought
to analyse the immunostimulatory potential of MV-
associated RNA and DNA, and to evaluate receptor-
mediated recognition of MV-associated RNA and DNA
molecules by innate immune cells.
Methods: By following a stringent purification proto-
col, we characterized the RNA and DNA content of
MVs produced by actively growing S. aureus. Nuclease
protection
assays
were
performed
to
determine
whether MV-associated nucleic acids are protected
from degradation. We assessed the immunomodula-
tory potential of MV-associated RNA and DNA by
treating cultured mouse macrophages with MVs and
measuring the induction of Interferon-β mRNA using
qPCR.
Results: We found that S. aureus secretes RNA and
DNA molecules that are mostly protected from degra-
dation by their association with MVs. We demonstrate
that MVs can be delivered into cultured macrophage

tors. This study advances our understanding of the
mechanisms by which bacterial nucleic acids are traf-
ficked extracellularly to trigger the modulation of host

Introduction: Urinary extracellular vesicle (UEV) tran-
scriptome could potentially reflect the kidney gene
expression profile and serve as virtual/liquid biopsy.
In order to explore this possibility, we performed
mRNA sequencing of UEVs from individuals with
type 1 diabetes to assess whether it can capture a
“kidney enriched genes” expression signature that
could lead to novel biomarker discovery for diabetic
kidney disease.
Methods: The study included 75 type 1 diabetic
individuals (41 normoalbuminuric, 15 microalbumi-
nuric and 19 macroalbuminuric). Urine samples
were collected either overnight (N = 38) or during
24-hours (N = 37) and UEVs were isolated from
20–30 ml of urine by differential centrifugation. The
EVs quality was ensured by Electron microscopy
(EM), western blotting and EV-RNAs – profiling
with the Bioanalyzer. Isolated RNAs were subjected
to RNA sequencing after cDNA library preparation
(ultra-low amount protocols) using HiSeq 2000
(Illumina)
pair-end
protocol.
The
association
between kidney specific gene expression levels (>4
fold higher compared to other tissues, N = 53) and
degree of albuminuria or glomerular filtration rate
was explored.
Results: Isolated EV quality appeared good by EM and
Western blotting. RNA quantity and quality were suffi-
cient for sequencing of all samples with >5 million pair
end reads. We detected on average expression of 12,642
genes. Principal component analysis (PC) of the
expression of all genes did not reveal any systematic
batch differences between the overnight and 24-hour
urine collections. Comprehensive look-up of 53 kid-
ney-enriched genes revealed expression of >73% (total
39) of these genes in urine EVs with high expression of
five
kidney-specific
genes
(SLC12A3,
SLC12A1,
NPHS2, AQP2 and SLC22A12). PC analysis combining
the impact of 39 kidney-enriched genes revealed that
most macroalbuminuric patients clustered together
along the PC1 axis, and the axis also correlated with
the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (p = 0.0004) explaining
11% of the variance (P = 0.005) in the whole data set.
The PC1 axis also showed correlation with HbA1c
(P = 0.003), but not with diabetes duration, BMI, age
and eGFR.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results show that urinary
EV transcriptome can capture kidney specific gene
expression signatures suggesting its potential as a vir-
tual kidney biopsy.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanos-
cale lipid particles secreted by all cells that mediate
intercellular communication by transferring encapsu-
lated proteins and nucleic acids between cells. Intrinsic
properties, such as non-toxicity and non-immunogeni-
city, and the ability to engineer EVs to incorporate
desired cargo and targeting moieties make them an
attractive delivery platform for a wide range of biomo-
lecules. One such application is the use of EVs to
deliver Cas9 ribonucleoprotein for targeted and trans-
latable in vivo gene editing. Overcoming this delivery
barrier could enable novel therapeutic strategies, such
as the inactivation of HIV proviral DNA in T cells to
eliminate the latent viral reservoir.
Methods: We developed a novel system for actively
loading functional Cas9 ribonucleoprotein into EVs
and for engineering these vesicles to target delivery of
Cas9 to recipient T cells. To promote specific interac-
tions with recipient cells, we developed a novel, high-
affinity EV targeting platform by displaying single-
chain variable fragments (scFvs) on the surface of the
vesicles. To enhance vesicle uptake by T cells, we used
viral glycoproteins to promote vesicle fusion at the cell
surface.
Results: We demonstrated directed loading of Cas9
ribonucleoprotein into engineered vesicle populations.
We enhanced receptor-dependent EV targeting to T
cells ~100-fold as compared to a non-targeted EV
control. Our approach, as well as display of fusion-
enhancing proteins, was successfully used to increase
EV uptake by recipient T cells, which exhibit low basal
rates of endocytosis and are difficult to deliver cargo to
by other means.
Summary/Conclusion: The ability to direct EV uptake
to desired cell types and uptake pathways within those
cells may ultimately enable functional delivery of bio-
molecular cargo for a wide range of targeted therapies.

Introduction: Due to their safety profile, tissue tropism
and long-term transgene expression, adeno-associated
viruses (AAVs) have become the vector of choice for
human gene therapy. However, pre-existing neutraliz-
ing antibodies (NAbs) to many AAV serotypes pose a
critical challenge for the translation of gene therapies to
clinic. Here, we describe the use of exosomal AAVs
(eAAV) as a robust cardiac gene delivery system that
enhance transduction efficiency while shielding from
pre-existing humoral immunity to the viral capsid.
Methods: We developed an ultracentrifugation-based
purification strategy to obtain eAAV specimens from
AAV-producing HEK-293 T cells, and used electron
microscopy-based visualization, confocal microscopy-
based colocalization studies, qPCR, immunoblotting,
dynamic lights scattering, ExoView technology and
protease assays to characterize eAAV morphology,
contents and mechanism of action. We then evaluated
efficiency of heart targeting for eAAV9 or eAAV6 and
standard AAV9 or AAV6 encoding for EGFP, mCherry
or firefly luciferase in different human cell lines in

bioluminescence imaging. Last, to test therapeutic effi-
cacy, eAAV9 or AAV9 vectors encoding for SERCA2a,
a sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine tripho-
sphatase, were injected intramyocardially in post-myo-
cardial
infarction
mice
preinjected
with
NAbs.
Echocardiography and histochemistry were used to
evaluate cardiac function and remodelling.
Results: We confirmed eAAV represent vesicular frac-
tions that exhibit common exosome morphology and
antigen expression, along with the presence of virus
particles, and demonstrated that eAAV infectious
entry potentially involves trafficking via endocytic
compartments. Regardless of the presence or absence
of NAbs, we showed in functional studies that eAAVs
are more efficient in cell transduction in the same titre
ranges
as
standard
AAVs.
Remarkably,
eAAV9-
SERCA2a outperformed standard AAVs significantly
improving cardiac function even in the presence of
NAbs (%EF 55.14 ± 3.50 compared to 27.31 ± 1.63 at
6 weeks, respectively).
Summary/Conclusion: Delivery of standard AAVs
protected by carrier exosomes (i.e. eAAVs) is a promis-
ing approach to evade pre-existing NAbs while still
efficiently transducing myocardium, which can be
applied in the broader population of patients with
myocardial infarction and may result in higher gene
delivery efficacy.

Introduction: The palliation of hypoplastic left heart
syndrome (HLHS), a complex congenital heart disease,
places significant demand on the right ventricle (RV)
to sustain systemic circulation, resulting in high RV
dysfunction-associated mortality. Cell-based therapies
may improve RV adaption to single ventricle physiol-
ogy, specifically through the release of pro-reparative
exosomes.
The
transplantation
of
bone
marrow-
derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a pulmon-
ary artery banding (PAB) swine model improves RV
function and led to the ELPIS clinical trial: Allogeneic
Human MSC Injection in Patients with HLHS. Here,
we model circulating MSC exosome cargo to predict
RV functional recovery in preclinical PAB model and
validate its translational potential in ELPIS subjects.
Methods: HLHS patients (n = 3) after Glenn procedure
and swine (n = 3) after PAB were given RV injections
of allogeneic/xenogeneic MSCs. Donor-specific, HLA-
I+, exosomes were isolated from plasma. In swine,
exosomes were collected and RV fractional area change
(FAC) was measured post-MSC-injection. In the ELPIS
patients, exosomes were collected and outcome mea-
surements (FAC, stroke volume (SV), RV mass) were
recorded 6 and 12-months post-injection. Exosomal
mRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and proteins were quan-
tified and partial least squares regression (PLSR)
reduced the dimensionality of the datasets to build a
swine model, upon which ELPIS outcome predictions
were made.
Results: Multiomics analysis of swine exosome cargo
revealed miRNA to be the largest contributor to overall
variance. In swine and ELPIS patients, miRNAs were
similarly
expressed
(98%,
fold-change<2).
PLSR
reduced the dimensionality of the swine miRNA data-
set to 50 miRNAs with the highest weighted coeffi-
cients for changes in FAC. Pathway analysis of
miRNA targets revealed links to smooth muscle cell
proliferation
and
cardiac
chamber
development.
Importantly, the swine miRNA PLSR model predicted
ELPIS patient improvements in FAC, SV, and RV mass
with strong correlation (r > 0.9).
Summary/Conclusion: These findings support the use
of: (1) swine PAB model for RV failure in HLHS, (2)
circulating donor-specific MSC-exosomal miRNA as a
novel, non-invasive biomarker of patient outcomes,
and (3) computational modelling to predict improve-
ments and inform clinical trials.

and potential toxicity. RNA nanotechnology is the bot-
tom-up self-assembly of nanometre-scale RNA archi-
tectures. We previously discovered a stable phi29
pRNA three-way junction (3WJ) motif and used it to
construct multivalent RNA nanoparticles with high
chemical and thermodynamic stability. The resulting
arrow-shape RNA nanoparticles are homogenous, uni-
form in size and shape, and can harbour different
functionalities while retaining their tertiary folding
and independent functionalities both in vitro and in
vivo. This flexible platform using RNA nanotechnology
to achieve tumour-specific targeting has been demon-

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain plasma
membrane surface markers that provide insights into
their cell source. Until now, our understanding of the
circulating EV-biome has been limited by the lack of cell-
and size-specific EV quantitation methods. We have
developed and validated a multiplex nanoscale flow cyto-
metry approach to image cell- and size-specific EV popu-
lations using a novel human “EV-Lyoplate” with 3
differently coloured monoclonal antibodies per well in a
96 well plate format (n = 242 separate antibodies with
isotype, stained PBS, unstained plasma, and quant-beads
controls per plate). We hypothesized that platelet poor
plasma samples from patients diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer would have significantly different EV-biome pro-
files than screen negative study subjects.
Methods: Study subjects were enrolled and sampled
before
clinically
scheduled
endoscopic
ultrasound-
guided biopsy (EUS-FNA) procedures to screen patients
with symptoms of pancreatic duct obstruction who later
had at least two years of clinical follow up, including
surgical resection in cases of pancreatic neoplasia
(n = 36) or at least one follow up clinic visit to confirm
resolution of symptoms. Blood samples were uniformly
collected, processed, and banked per ISEV recom-
mended guidelines. Uniform machine (FACSymphony)
settings to standardize light scatter and fluorescence
detection were based on commercially available beads
(eg. Megamix). Samples were coded and randomized for
testing and results were reported as the mean cell- and
size-specific EV events/ul of plasma.
Results: Clinical outcomes confirmed 10 cases of can-
cer and 26 screen negative controls. Principle compo-
nent analysis suggested that a number of different cell-
and size-specific EVs were significantly more common
in the cancer cases (adjusted p-value < 0.05, with AUCs
>0.80), including Epcam+/CD63+ events likely from
cancer cells and CD41+/CD62p+/CD9+ microvesicles
from platelets, among others.
Summary/Conclusion: In this proof of principle study
employing an EV-Lyoplate design and nanoscale flow
cytometry, we could reliably discriminate the EV-biomes
in patients with cancer from negative controls. Ongoing
studies will determine whether these discriminators will
be validated in larger cohorts and provide at least non-
inferior predictive value compared with the current gold
standard clinical testing assay (EUS-FNA).

Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA
Introduction: Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is an
aggressive tumour type, usually metastatic at diagnostic
leading to poor overall survival. Interestingly, SCLC
tumours are composed by distinct subpopulations of
cells that cooperate as an ecosystem to drive tumour
survival. Since the subtype of SCLC may have prog-
nostic significance, the aim of this study was to identify
surface marker proteins as biomarkers of SCLC.
Methods: A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model,
implemented in Python via Sci-kit learn, was used to
choose the best 4 markers for distinguishing subtypes.
This analysis was based on RNA-seq data from a pre-
vious study. In order to identify EV-based biomarkers
that would identify SCLC EVs and not normal EVs, we
excluded from this analysis proteins without a verified
transmembrane domain and proteins associated with
EVs expected to be present in white and red blood
cells, and endothelial cells (according to Exocarta and
Vesiclepedia databases). We also prioritized proteins
that could be pan markers for SCLC and that might
have prognostic significance. To validate our findings,

we performed Western blotting and Flow cytometry in
SCLC cell lines from different subtypes.
Results: Our RNA analysis indicated that the best 4 surface
markers to distinguish SCLC subtypes were CEACAM5,
FAM174A, LRFN1, EPHA2. Immunoblot analysis vali-
dated CEACAM5 and EPHA2 but not FAM174A or
LRFN1. We also found that NCAM1, a commonly used
SCLC marker, only marks some of the subtypes. For
further analysis, we chose proteins with antibodies vali-
dated for flow cytometry as our chosen biomarker plat-
form. Flow cytometry analysis of CD24 is suitable as a pan-
SCLC marker. However, the expression of NON-NE cell
lines was decreased compared to RNA-seq data.
Summary/Conclusion: Protein analysis of CEACAM5
and EPHA2 corresponded to RNA-seq data. NCAM
was not detected as a pan marker for all SCLC sub-
types. However, we could see CD24 expression in all
SCLC subtypes, indicating it may be a useful pan
marker for SCLC. Future studies will be performed to
validate the expression of other surface markers in
cells, purified EVs, and plasma of SCLC patients.

Introduction: In cancer, extracellular vesicles (EVs) act
as a unique exit mechanism for mutant and oncogenic
macromolecules (proteins, RNA and DNA) en route
from malignant cells to blood1. While this process has
inspired major liquid biopsy efforts, the biology of
circulating EVs that carry oncogenic mutations (onco-
somes)2 is still poorly characterized. It is also unclear
what part (if any) of the tumour-related cell free DNA
(ctDNA)3,4, a major liquid biopsy analyte, is linked to
circulating EVs and what is their fate, receptacles and
biological activity.
Methods: We employed as series of cancer cell lines carry-
ing mutations in major oncogenes (HRAS, HER2,
EGFRvIII). EV-DNA was analysed by digital droplet PCR
(ddPCR), along with nuclear anomalies in donor cells
(DAPI, Electron Microscopy) and transfer of DNA to
recipient cells of endothelial (HUVEC, MMBEC), astrocy-
tic (NHA) or myeloid (HL60) origin. Blood underwent
fractionation into red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells
(WBC), platelets (PLT), EVs (100,000g ultracentrifugation)
and soluble plasma (SUP)5.
Results: HRAS-mediated cellular transformation (in RAS-
3 cells) triggers profound changes in the structure of
nuclear chromatin, which is driven into the cytoplasm
and released as cargo of EVs. Oncogenic DNA is detectable
in blood fractions of tumour bearing mice. While EVs,
ctDNA and PLTs contain intermediate levels of mutant
DNA, RBCs contain only traces of this material. The high-
est HRAS copy number per ml of blood is found in WBCs
(monocytes and neutrophils), which contain more cancer
DNA/cell than liver, spleen and bone marrow. Depletion
of neutrophils using anti-Ly6G antibody results in an
increase in EV- and ctDNA-associated mutant DNA in
blood, suggesting the role of these cells in regulating the
circulating levels of cancer cell-derived particles. Uptake of
DNA-containing EVs impacts the phenotype of myeloid
cells, which adopt thrombo-inflammatory properties.
These cells also retain cancer-specific transcripts and
other cargo. Finally, normal astrocytes treated with onco-
genic EVs also exhibit phenotypic changes and signs of
genomic instability including formation of micronuclei.
Summary/Conclusion: We propose that the process of
leukocyte sequestration of circulating particles containing
tumour-related nucleic acids renders these cells potentially
usable as a novel liquid biopsy platform (LEUKOBIOPSY)
in cancer. 1. PMID:18425114; 2. PMID:27680302; 3.PMID:

Introduction: Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer
(CRC) and precancerous adenoma patients is of vital
importance. Previously we profiled small extracellular
vesicles (sEVs) derived miRNAs isolated from plasma,
proposed a new promising biomarker category of CRC
patients. Here we further gave a full landscape of cir-
culating sEVs derived RNAs to explore and evaluate
sEVs based RNA biomarkers for early detection of both
CRC and adenoma patients.

Methods: Plasma sEVs were isolated from 60 participants,
including 31 early-stage CRC patients, 19 adenoma
patients, and 10 normal controls (NC), and characterized
according to MISV2018 guideline. The total sEVs derived
RNA expression profile of all participants was investigated
by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Weighted gene
coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed
to categorize differentially expressed RNAs, and t-distrib-
uted stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) was adopted
to distinguish CRC, adenoma, from NC samples with the
top-ranked genes in WGCNA modules. RT-qPCR valida-
tion was performed in a cohort of 120 additional
participants.
Results: A total of 1615 RNA species (including miRNAs,
mRNAs, and lncRNAs) were found differentially expressed
between plasma sEVs in CRC and NC participants.
Additionally,
888
RNA
species
were
differentially
expressed between plasma sEVs in adenoma and NC par-
ticipants. 1160 RNA species were differentially expressed
between plasma sEVs in CRC and adenoma participants.
WGCNA categorized all RNAs into 6 modules, which
exhibited different expression trends during the carcino-
genesis of CRC. A 60-gene combined tSNE model consists
of the top 10 genes in each module could perfectly classify
CRC, adenoma, and NC samples. A 6-gene combined
tSNE model consists of the top 1 gene in each module
could roughly distinguish CRC and adenoma from NC,
with only 1 sample misclassified. RT-qPCR assays also
confirmed the potential classification ability of those
genes in another validation cohort of 120 participants.
Summary/Conclusion: Circulating sEVs have a dis-
tinct RNA profile in both CRC and adenoma patients
as compared to normal controls. sEVs derived RNA
biomarker combination could for Early Detection of
Colorectal Carcinoma and Adenoma.

Introduction: Although the concept of systematic
“liquid biopsy” using bodily fluids is simple and ele-
gant, the path of clinical reality has been challenging.
Recently, numerous tissue-specific biomarkers have
been discovered in EVs derived from blood, urine,
cerebrospinal fluid, cell culture media, and a variety
of other fluids. However, tracing the lineage of EVs to
their tissue of origin remains challenging due to their
minute amount of cargo and unavailability of match-
ing biopsied tissue and bodily fluids from the same
patient.
We recently demonstrated in three separate pub-
lications (Dogra et. al; Smith et. al; Murillo et. al), a
new device (nanoDLD) for EV isolations, it’s compar-
ison with current technologies, bioengineered vesicles,
and a detailed study of RNA types present in small/
large vesicles, lipoproteins, and Ago2 protein in dif-
ferent biofluids. In the present study, we aim to inves-
tigate the lineage of prostate derived EVs in biofluids.
Methods: Using our chip technology, we have isolated
exosomes from prostate cancer cell lines and patient
tissue, blood and urine samples. After exosome isola-
tion, small RNA libraries were prepared, and sequen-
cing is carried out at Icahn School of Medicine and
New York Genome Center using illumine sequencer
HISeq2500. Our nanofluidic pillar array is manufac-
tured in an SiO2 mask using optical contact lithogra-
phy and deep ultraviolet lithography.
Results: Our study revealed i) RNA markers, which are
exclusive to their prostate tissue of origin and are
secreted in EVs; ii) approximately 1–3% of prostate
tissue-specific RNA were discovered in EVs; iii) Over
77% (17 of 22 RNA) of literature curated prostate-
specific RNA signatures were detectable in serum and
urine EVs from PCa patients; iv) EVs contained over
50–70% of noncoding RNA (40–60% was miRNA),
while tissue predominantly yielded rRNA (>60%); v)
Finally, gene set analyses generated that over 90% of
EVs RNA were enriched for signalling pathways, yield-
ing miRNA-associated, non-canonical Wnt signalling,
and androgen receptor pathways. This study enables us
to noninvasively monitor prostate tissue-specific bio-
markers, identify tumour-specific RNA, and potentially
may benefit in liquid biopsy by avoiding unnecessary
surgical procedures.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, we have investi-
gated patient matched tissue, serum, and urine derived
EVs in prostate cancer. We present a set of 68 prostatic

Introduction:
Pancreatic
ductal
adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) is the third largest contributor to cancer-
related death in the USA. Since there is not yet a
feasible technology to diagnose PDAC early in the
disease, 80% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced
stage. Moreover, for patients with confirmed PDAC,
standard imaging method has low sensitivity to detect
early metastatic disease, which complicates the selec-
tion of therapy.
To address these challenges, there has been great
interest in developing minimally-invasive, extracellular
vesicle (EV) based blood tests for PDAC. To this end,
we
have
integrated
measurements
of
tumour
derivedEV RNA cargo with circulating proteins and
cell free DNA (cfDNA), and use machine learning
algorithms to distill this multiplexed diagnostic to 1.
diagnose PDAC patients from healthy and disease con-
trols and 2. distinguish PDAC patients with distance
sites of metastasis to guide their treatment. We make
use of our lab’s magnetic nanopore isolation technique
to specifically enrich for tumour derived EVs directly
from patient plasma.
Methods: We have developed a high throughput nano-
fluidic sorting platform, which immunomagnetically
isolates individual EVs from plasma using magnetic
nanostructures. However, our architectures is uniquely
designed for massive parallelization allowing high
throughput, robust processing of mL of plasma in
minutes. We performed sequencing on a discovery set
of patients and controls (N = 29). Subsequently, we
trained our panel of biomarkers using a training set of
N = 47. Finally, we validated the performance of our
platform using an independent blinded test set of
N = 145.
Results: The results of a blinded test set achieved an
accuracy = 92% and an AUC = 0.95 on binary classifica-
tion of PDAC patients versus those that were healthy or
disease controls. In addition, we achieved an AUC = 0.85
and accuracy = 89% with sensitivity of 90% and specificity
of 88% on detecting occult metastasist.
Summary/Conclusion: We developed a highly sen-
sitive pancreatic cancer diagnostics by combining
our nanomagnetic isolation platform for tumour-
derived
EV
isolation,
RNA
sequencing,
and
machine learning. We isolated tumour-derived EVs
and
profiled
their
RNA
cargo,
combined
with
cfDNA and CA19-9 for pancreatic cancer diagnosis.
The
predictive
panels
successfully
distinguished
non-cancer patients from PDAC patients, and no-
distant metastasis patients(M0) from distant metas-
tasis patients(M1) for appropriate treatment. The
resulting AUC and accuracy from the independent
blinded test set outperformed any individual bio-
marker, showing both the benefits and the robust-
ness of combining multiple orthogonal biomarkers
for PDAC diagnosis.

Canada; bOttawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada
Introduction: Both hypertension and diabetes exhibit
significant molecular changes to the vasculature that
are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Here
we examined the protein composition of large EVs (L-
EVs) isolated from the plasma of hypertensive, diabetic
and healthy mice to identify common and disease-
specific molecular changes.
Methods: We examined circulating L-EVs isolated
from transgenic mice expressing active human renin
in the liver (TtRhRen, a model of hypertension),
OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice, and their wild-type
(WT) littermates. At 20 weeks of age mice were sacri-
ficed and blood samples were obtained by cardiac
puncture.
L-EVs
were
isolated
from
platelet-free
plasma via differential centrifugation and protein con-
tent was assessed via mass spectrometry (MS).
Results: TtRhRen mice exhibited increased blood pres-
sure compared with OVE26 mice or their WT litter-
mates. (144.2 ± 7.6 vs 123.5 ± 4.9 [OVE26] vs.
114.6 ± 5.7 mmHg [WT], p < 0.05). MS identified
297 independent proteins with at least 2 peptides per
protein. Of these, 163 proteins were found in all groups
studied, 48 were exclusive to WT mice, 23 were exclu-
sive to OVE26 mice and 4 were exclusive to TtRhRen
mice. In addition, 22 proteins were observed with >1.5
fold change (FC) compared to wild-type mice, and 68
proteins were reduced by >50%. Amongst the top ten
differentially expressed proteins, fibrinogen was upre-
gulated in both OVE26 and TtRhRen mice compared
with wild-type controls. Similarly Trem-like transcript
1,
sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
reticulum
calcium
ATPase 3 and junction plakoglobin were all downre-
gulated in both OVE26 mice and TtRhRen mice sug-
gesting molecular changes common to both conditions.
Conversely, arginase was up-regulated in diabetic, but
not hypertensive mice while carboxypeptidase was up-
regulated in hypertensive but not diabetic mice.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, these results
show that the protein composition of circulating L-
EVs is altered in diabetes and hypertension and that
both common and disease-specific changes may be
detected. Further analysis of these changes may lead
to the identification of novel pathways associated with
the pathogenesis of vascular injury in hypertension and
diabetes.

Introduction: Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are a class
of large (~1-5um) EVs formed during apoptotic cell
disassembly, that are becoming increasingly recognized
as potential mediators of intercellular communication,
e.g. via the transfer of proteins and other cargoes to
target cells. During the inflammatory vascular disease
atherosclerosis, endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis contri-
butes to loss of barrier function and promotes the
formation of plaques in regions of EC damage.
Although, experimentally, ECs generate an abundance
of ApoBDs, a specific role for EC-derived ApoBDs
(EC-ApoBDs) in the progression of atherosclerosis
remains poorly defined.
Methods: In the present study, a detailed in vitro
characterization of EC disassembly was performed via
flow cytometry, confocal live cell imaging and cytokine
profiling, followed by function analyses of EC-ApoBDs
using a murine in vivo model of dead cell clearance.
Results: Characterization of EC disassembly revealed
that ApoBD formation in ECs is regulated by rho-

inhibited using a ROCK-1 inhibitor, thereby providing
tools for functional in vivo studies. The specific cargo
and role in clearance of EC-ApoBDs were then inves-
tigated. Profiling of EC-ApoBDs was performed via
cytokine antibody array to reveal that EC-ApoBDs
generated
under
inflammatory
conditions
contain
high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including
MCP-1 and IL-8, suggesting a potential role for EC-
ApoBDs in the propagation of inflammation during
vascular disease. Furthermore, the ability of EC-
ApoBDs to be cleared from the vasculature via phago-
cytosis was investigated, revealing that EC-ApoBDs can
travel to distal organs to undergo clearance.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings provide impor-
tant insights into the potential functions of EC-
ApoBDs generated under both non-inflammatory and
inflammatory conditions and may contribute to future
studies involving the therapeutic targeting of EC dis-
assembly for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

Introduction: Cardio-renal syndromes (CRS) are dis-
orders of the heart and kidneys whereby “acute or
chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce dysfunc-
tion of the other”. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) mediates the protection of the kidney from
development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We
here investigated the potential of adipose-mesenchymal
stromal cells derived EVs (ASC-EVs) as therapeutic
tools for the treatment of CRS.
Methods: Adult Wistar rats were uninephrectomized
and treated with a high-Na+ diet and deoxycorticoster-
one-acetate (DOCA-salt) for 8-weeks (038/15; A02/16-
61-15).
EVs
were
isolated
by
ultracentrifugation
method. EV dimension, concentration and surface
markers were characterized by NTA, cytofluorimetric
analysis and transmission electron microscopy. To
characterize the role of EVs in CRS, DOCA-salt rats
were injected weekly with ASC-EVs. Systolic blood
pressure
was
measured
by
the
tail-cuff
method.
Plasma creatinine and urinary protein excretion were
determined by colorimetric assays and microalbumi-
nuria by immune turbidimetric assay. qRT-PCR and
western blot were conducted to evaluate fibrosis and
inflammatory-related genes and proteins in the kidney
and heart of DOCA-salt rats. Immunohistochemistry
was used to confirm matrix accumulation (a-SMA) and
immune infiltrate (CD68+ cells).
Results:
Multiple
administration
of
ASC-EVs
in
DOCA-salt rats induced a protective effect on the
kidney, by reducing tubular and vascular damage.
Kidney function was also conserved by EV treatment
as detected by the normal glomerular filtration rate and
the absence of proteinuria with respect to DOCA-salt
untreated
rats.
EV
administration
significantly
decreases the pro-inflammatory molecules MCP-1 and
PAI1 and reduce the recruitment of macrophages in
the
kidney.
The
mitigation
of
the
inflammatory
response by ASC-EV infusion consequentially affected
the development of fibrosis, as detected by the decrease
in collagens (Col1A1, Col4A1) and fibronectin (FN)
expression in respect to DOCA-salt animals. ASC-
EVs were able to act in multiple organs, preventing
fibrosis and inflammation also in the heart, therefore
alleviating blood pressure rise during the 8-weeks of
treatment in DOCA-salt rats.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results indicate that ASC-
EV administrations in hypertensive-induced CKD rats
promote protection from renal damage, reduction of
the inflammatory response and prevention of intersti-
tial fibrosis in the kidney. ASC-EVs are also able to
protect the cardiac tissue and to control blood pressure
increase, displaying complex and multiorgan beneficial
effects.

Glycolytic restraint in alveolar macrophages is critical for vesicular secre-
tion of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3

Michigan, Ann Arbour, USA
Introduction: Alveolar macrophages (AMs) tonically
secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing suppres-
sor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) protein. Uptake of
SOCS3-containing EVs by alveolar epithelial cells is
critical for restraint of cytokine-induced Janus kinase-
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK-
STAT3) signalling to promote homoeostasis in the
distal lung. At steady state, AMs exhibit suppressed
glycolytic activity, a metabolic phenotype that pro-
motes homoeostatic function. Whether this glycolytic
restraint is critical for AM secretion of SOCS3 is
unknown. In fact, to our knowledge, metabolic control
over release of any EV cargo has never been explored
in any cellular context.
Methods: Immortalized mouse AMs (MH-S) were
treated with various doses of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-
DG) and oligomycin, inhibitors of glycolysis and oxi-
dative phosphorylation, respectively. Primary rat AMs
collected by lung lavage were treated with an aqueous
extract of cigarette smoke (CSE) with or without 2-DG.
Metabolic activity was measured by Seahorse assay,
EVs were quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis,
and vesicular (>100-kDa) SOCS3 secretion was deter-
mined
by
western
blot
of
conditioned
medium.
Additionally, AMs collected from wild-type (WT) and
LSL-KrasG12D mice bearing lung tumours 16 weeks
after intrapulmonary Ad-Cre were cultured ex vivo in
the presence or absence of 2-DG. Vesicular (>100-kDa)
SOCS3 secretion was measured by ELISA.
Results: In a dose-dependent manner, oligomycin
inhibited, whereas 2-DG enhanced, SOCS3 and EV
release by MH-S cells. Treatment of rat AMs with
CSE (1%) attenuated secretion of SOCS3, an effect
that coincided with increases in glycolytic activity,
and co-treatment of AMs with 2-DG abrogated the
inhibitory effect of CSE on SOCS3 release. Finally,
AMs collected from LSL-KrasG12D mice exhibited a
deficiency in SOCS3 secretion relative to WT AMs, an
effect that was reversible by overnight culture in the
presence of 2-DG.
Summary/Conclusion: In tandem, our data generated
using in vitro and in vivo approaches demonstrate that
AM secretion of vesicular SOCS3 is down-regulated by
glycolysis. We speculate that metabolic control over
release of EV cargoes is a phenomenon of broad bio-
logic relevance within and outside of the lung.

Introduction: Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EV) are
described to play roles in defence and resistance,
pathogenesis and stress responses. Cyanobacteria pio-
neered oxygenic photosynthesis, and are the ancestors
of modern chloroplasts. We previously described that
by deleting the gene encoding TolC (ΔtolC) in the
model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC6803
(S6803), a key player in protein-mediated secretion
systems, a hyper-vesiculating phenotype could be
obtained. The goal of this work was to understand
why ΔtolC hyper-vesiculates.

Methods: Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute
Quantitation (iTRAQ) was used for quantitative pro-
teomic analyses of total cell extracts. EV were isolated
as follows: cells were separated from the extracellular
medium (EM) by centrifugation (4400 g, 10 min) and
filtration (0.2 µm pore-size filters). Cell-free EM was
concentrated using centrifugal filters (MWCO of 100
kDa), and later ultracentrifuged for 3 h at 100000 g.
The final EV fraction was suspended in growth med-
ium. EV characterization was performed using TEM,
DLS, Nanosight, and by the detection and quantifica-
tion of LPS (lipopolysaccharides). Detection of specific
proteins in EV was carried out by Western blot.
Copper (Cu) levels were quantified by atomic absorp-
tion spectrometry (AAS).
Results: A large-scale quantitative proteomic analysis
was performed, resulting in the identification of several
metal-related proteins with differential regulation in
S6803 ΔtolC. Both wild-type (WT) and ΔtolC cells
were then challenged with different metals. Compared
to the WT, ΔtolC showed impaired growth only when
exposed to Cu, a co-factor for several proteins with
roles in primary metabolism. The intracellular Cu
levels were quantified and ΔtolC accumulates threefold
more Cu than WT cells. We then asked whether the
hyper-vesiculating phenotype observed could be linked
to the stress induced by Cu accumulation. In EV iso-
lated from ΔtolC we detected the metallochaperone
CopM, a periplasmic Cu-binding protein involved in
Cu-resistance mechanisms in S6803. In addition, Cu
could also be detected in isolated ΔtolC-EV. In addi-
tion, more EV were detected when S6803 WT cells
were challenged with Cu, in a Cu-concentration depen-
dent manner.
Summary/Conclusion: These results support the idea
that bacterial EV represent an alternative Cu-secretion
mechanism to deal with Cu-induced stress.

Ciliary EV cargo sorting and biogenesis in living animals
Juan Wang and Maureen Barr
Rutgers University, Human Genetics Institute of NJ, Piscataway, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) function in
intercellular communication. Despite their physiologi-
cal importance and biomedical relevance, knowledge of
EV fundamental biology is not well understood, in part
due to a lack of tractable animal systems. Our analysis
of environmentally-released C. elegans ciliary EVs pro-
vides strong evidence that nematodes package cargo in
EVs that mediate inter-organismal communication, in
analogy to intercellular signalling in mammals. We
predict that conserved mechanisms underlie EV cargo
sorting, biogenesis and signalling.
Cilia act as cell towers to both receive extracellular
signals and to send information via ciliary EVs. Ciliary
defects result in human ciliopathies including autoso-
mal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
ADPKD is a life-threatening disease that affects 1/800
and is caused by mutations in PKD1 and PKD2, which
encode polycystin-1 and −2. In C. elegans and humans,
the polycystins are architecturally similar, act in the
same genetic pathway, function in a sensory capacity,
localize to cilia, and are shed in EVs, suggesting ancient
conservation. Moreover, ciliary EV biogenesis and
shedding is an evolutionary conserved process from
algae to worms to humans. By studying how cilia
make and receive EVs, we aim to uncover fundamental
principles of how cells communicate using EVs.
Methods: To study ciliary EV cargo sorting and bio-
genesis, we use genetically-encoded fluorescent-tagged
EV cargo and superresolution Zeiss Airyscan confocal
microscopy in living animals.
Results: We find that cargoes are sorted into distinct
populations. In cilia, kinesin-2 motors and kinesin-3
KLP-6/KIF28 transport different EV cargoes to the
ciliary tip and generate an EV cargo enrichment zone.
From here, EVs are shed and released into environ-
ment in a spatially and temporally regulated manner.
Ciliary EV biogenesis and release is regulated by
mechanical pressure and pH. Our work reveals – at
the single cell level – that different EVs are made in
response to environmental stimuli, which may be
important for EV signalling properties.
Summary/Conclusion:
Cells
exploit
the
spatially-
restricted cilium and its sophisticated transport system
to generate distinct populations of ciliary EVs. How
these ciliary EV communicate cellular messages awaits
decoding.

mechanisms of Rab11-exosome subtype regulation

Introduction: We recently demonstrated that recycling
endosomes marked by Rab11a generate exosome sub-
types distinct in cargos and functions from late endo-
somes, which we collectively term Rab11-exosomes.
These exosomes are preferentially released from cancer
cells in response to metabolic stress and promote adap-
tive changes in a xenograft model. Here we use com-
parative EV proteomics in HCT116 colorectal and
HeLa cervical cancer cell lines to identify Rab11-exo-
some signature proteins and screen for functional
effects.
Methods: We analysed EV preparations by mass spec-
trometry using Tandem Mass Tag® labelling to identify
changes in EV protein cargo in response to glutamine
depletion. Candidate genes were subsequently knocked
down in Drosophila secondary cells, which permit
visualisation of Rab11-exosome biogenesis using fluor-
escence microscopy, and in human cancer cell lines.
Results: We show that accessory ESCRT-III proteins,
CHMP5, CHMP1 and IST1, are enriched on gluta-
mine-depletion-induced EVs and play a selective and
conserved role in generating Rab11-exosomes. They
are, however, not required to traffic ubiquitinated car-
gos into late endosomes and lysosomes. ESCRT-0 com-
ponents,
thought
to
regulate
trafficking
of
ubiquitinated cargos into intraluminal vesicles, are
also required to make Rab11-exosomes. In flies the
ESCRT-0, Hrs, localises to the limiting membrane of
Rab11-endosomes. Comparative proteomics reveals
other proteins enriched in Rab11-exosomes, which
also appear to be needed to mediate this novel exosome
formation mechanism.
Summary/Conclusion: We conclude that Rab11-exo-
some subtypes are formed via a distinct mechanism
requiring accessory ESCRT-III components, suggesting
a route to selectively target these exosomes.

Introduction: The tumour microenvironment consists
of a complex network of host cells embedded within
extracellular matrix. Communication between these cel-
lular compartments is critical for tumour progression
and exosomes have emerged as important regulators of
intercellular communication. While a number of studies
have
implicated
exosomes
in
cancer
progression,
mechanisms controlling exosome transfer are not well
understood. We developed three-dimensional (3D) cul-
ture models to evaluate the role of cues provided by the
extracellular matrix in exosome release and uptake.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from cells in two- and
three-dimensional culture via ultracentrifugation and
characterized by Nanosight, Qubit protein quantification,
and
flow
cytometry analysis of
exosome
markers.
Exosomes were labelled with fluorescent lipophilic dyes
and uptake in recipient cells quantified by flow cytometry.
Results: Cells cultured in 2D display decreased exo-
some release and increased uptake compared to 3D
cultured cells. Exosome release in 3D culture was
inhibited with the exosome release inhibitors brefeldin
A and GW4869, but was not significantly altered by
knockout of Rab27B. In addition, disruption of polarity
signals provided by 3D culture did not impact exosome
release or uptake in 3D, but induction of oncogenic
HRAS increased both secretion and uptake of exo-
somes through activation of PI3 K signalling.
Summary/Conclusion: Release and uptake of exosomes
is altered in 3D environments. These studies help pro-
vide insight into exosome production and uptake in vivo
and have potential implications for therapeutically tar-
geting exosome release and the development of exosome
based therapeutic delivery vehicles.

Introduction: Previous studies in our lab found that
expression of R345 W-Fibulin-3 induces RPE to
undergo EMT. The purpose of current study was to
characterize the extracellular vesicles (EVs) in RPE cells
expressing WT-Fibulin-3 versus RPE cells expressing
R345 W-Fibulin-3 and investigate the effects of these
EVs on RPE cell differentiation.
Methods: ARPE-19 cells were infected with lentivirus
with luciferase-tagged wild-type (WT)-Fibulin-3 or
luciferase-tagged R345 W-Fibulin-3. EVs were isolated
from the media of ARPE-19 cells by conventional
ultracentrifugation or density gradient ultracentrifuga-
tion. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) were per-
formed to study the morphology of the EVs. The
amount and size distribution of EVs were analysed by
Nanosight Tracking Analysis (NTA). EV protein con-
centrations were quantified using the DCTM Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad). EV cargo were analysed by unbiased
proteomics using LC-MS/MS with subsequent pathway
analysis (Advaita). Migration ability was evaluated in
ARPE-19 cells with or without the exposure of EVs by
conducting scratch assays.
Results: Morphologically, TEM imaging
showed
concave-appearing vesicles and cryo-EM imaging
showed spherical vesicles with two subpopulations
of EVs: a small group with diameters around 30 nm
and a large group with diameters around 100 nm.
Moreover, TEM and cryo-EM showed an increased
amount of small EVs (~30 nm) in the mutant group
compared to the WT group. This result was further
confirmed by NTA showing that, in the mutant
group, the particle size distributions were smaller
than the WT EVs. No significant differences were
shown in EV protein concentrations per particle
between WT and mutant groups. Our previous data
suggest that the expression of R345 W-fibulin-3
causes RPE cells to undergo EMT as evidenced by
upregulated EMT drivers and an increased migration
ability. Proteomic studies showed that EVs derived
from ARPE-19 cells overexpressing WT-fibulin-3
contain critical members of sonic hedgehog signal-
ling (SHH) and ciliary tip components, whereas EVs
derived from RPE cells overexpressing R345 W-
Fibulin-3 contain EMT mediators, indicating that
EV cargo reflects the phenotypic status of their par-
ental cells. EV transplant studies showed that expos-
ing native RPE cells to mutant RPE cell-derived EVs
containing EMT drivers, including TGF-β-induced
protein (TGFBI), VIM, and SMAD4, leads to an
enhanced migration ability of RPE cells in a dose-
dependent manner.
Summary/Conclusion: The expression of R345 W-
Fibulin-3 promotes EMT in RPE cells and leads to
the secretion of EVs containing EMT drivers. EVs
derived from RPE cells overexpressing R345 W-
Fibulin-3 are sufficient for inducing EMT in native
RPE cells.

Introduction: Despite of high expectations, mesenchy-
mal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapies still lack effi-
cacy, partially due to loss of cell viability and function
upon administration. MSC-derived extracellular vesi-
cles (MSC-EV) emulate the regenerative potential of
MSC, shifting the field towards cell-free therapies.
Clinical applications require the establishment of a
scalable and GMP-compliant processes for the produc-
tion and isolation of MSC-EV, combined with robust
characterization platforms.
Methods: To develop a well-established process for
the production of therapeutic MSC-EV, we compared
different MSC sources (bone marrow, adipose tissue,
umbilical cord matrix), culture media compositions
(DMEM supplemented with foetal bovine serum
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), DMEM supplemented
with human platelet lysate (AventaCell Biomedical)
and StemPro MSC SFM Xeno Free medium (Thermo
Fisher Scientific)) and culture parameters (oxygen
tension and shear stress) in two different culture
platforms (2D static tissue
culture flask vs 3D
dynamic spinner vessels). Subsequently, MSC-EV
were isolated by ultracentrifugation or a commer-
cially available isolation kit and characterized accord-
ing to ISEV guidelines.
Results: MSC derived from different sources/donors
were able to grow under normoxia and hypoxia in 2D
T-flasks and 3D spinner vessel culture systems, while
maintaining
their
immunophenotype
and
differentiation potential, according to the minimal cri-
teria defined by the ISCT. The time point for pre-con-
ditioning and collection of conditioned medium for
MSC-EV isolation was also optimized for both 2D and
3D
culture
systems.
MSC-EV
were
characterized
according to MISEV 2018 guidelines, using techniques
as NTA, protein and lipid quantification, western blot,
imaging and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR). The results indicate that MSC-EV derived from
different sources/donors have similar size distribution,
however, EV yields tend to be higher for the 3D culture
system. Of notice, several spectral regions were identi-
fied by FTIR, enabling the detection of differences in the
biomolecules present in MSC-EV, MSC-conditioned
media and cells produced under different conditions.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, this study contri-
butes to the establishment of a scalable process for
MSC-EV production.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have great
potential in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and pro-
gression monitoring to complement the inaccurate
prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and invasive-
ness of tissue biopsy. However, current methods cannot
isolate pure EVs and therefor EVs characteristics remain
largely unknown. In order to develop an accurate
approach for EV isolation, we aimed to compare three
emerging methods with different characteristics of small

choose the best one for diagnostic and functional studies
Methods: PCa patients and age-matched healthy con-

isolate sEVs with 3 different isolation methods includ-
ing commercial ExoQuick Ultra Kit, qEV 35 and qEV
70 size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Isolated sEV
were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis,
immunoblotting, cyrogenic electron microscopy, flow
cytometry (FC) and proteomics analysis. For FC char-
acterizing surface marker expression, the sEVs were
further purified by CD9 and CD81 commercial immu-
noaffinity magnetic beads . Lipoprotein was captured
by streptavidin biotinylated ApoB magnetic beads to
measuring the lipoprotein contamination
Results: The sEV size, morphology, surface protein and
protein cargo with proteomics were analysed between the
three isolation methods. sEVs isolated from SEC methods
had a lower particle size, protein amount, protein/sEV
marker ratio and ApoB+/sEV marker ratio than those
from ExoQuick Ultra method. In addition, sEVs isolated
from qEV35 demonstrated a significantly higher sEV
content, more up-regulated and down-regulated PCa
proteins from proteomics but lower sEV marker/protein
ratio and a higher protein contamination than those from
qEV70. Furthermore, sEV marker signal also showed a
good correlation with particle numbers instead of protein
content in all the methods
Summary/Conclusion: qEV 70 method demonstrated
better performance in isolating relatively pure sEVs
from human plasma; qEV35 has the better perfor-
mance in isolating samples with higher sEV content;
ExoQuick Ultra isolated samples with closely sEV con-
tent to the qEV35 but with the highest non-sEV pro-
tein contaminations. People can choose higher sEV
content or higher sEV purity according to the down-
stream analysis

Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) (30–
200 nm in diameter) are secreted by most cells, includ-
ing tumour cells. They have attracted interest as
biomarker for cancer diagnostics based on liquid biop-
sies, because they are abundant in body fluids and their
content (proteins, RNAs and other cargos) reflects
their parent cells. Moreover, sEVs may also be used
for treatment monitoring, as recent studies suggested
that the expression levels of certain markers may
change during therapy, reflecting tumour response.
For cancer diagnostics and therapeutic purposes in
clinical settings, it is important to have a device
which allows multiplexed measurements, in order to
scan a large number of markers simultaneously and
compare the expression levels of different patients, or
same patients at different treatment stages, in a time
efficient manner.
Methods: Herein, we propose a multiplexed platform
for label-free detection and surface protein profiling of
sEVs. The technique is based on the electrokinetic
phenomena of streaming current and zeta potential
(\zeta*) and measures the\zeta* change upon sEV bind-
ing on functionalized microcapillary surfaces. For the
purpose, we used sEVs derived from lung cancer cells.
In its current form, the platform can measure up to 5
channels simultaneously, however, it can be further
expanded.
Results: Having demonstrated that our electrokinetic
sensor successfully detects sEVs in a specific way, we
tested its ability to measure the expression level of
membrane proteins. The analysis showed that it could
detect differences in the expressions of EGFR on sEVs,
with a sensitivity of 10%. We then extended the plat-
form for multiplexed analysis, by connecting and mea-
suring four capillaries, functionalized with different
capture probes, simultaneously. For the purpose, we
targeted specific tumour markers, i.e. EGFR, and exo-
somal tetraspanin family proteins, such as CD9 and
CD63. The results showed successful multiplexed EV
detection.
Summary/Conclusion: Being the sensor suitable for
multiplexed sEV detection, we shall present our inves-
tigation on a set of pleural effusion samples collected
from a cohort of lung-cancer patients with different
genetic makeup.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released
to biological fluids from different tissues and organs
and they contain molecules proposed as biomarkers for
multiple pathological conditions. However, most EV
biomarkers have not been validated due to the lack of
sensitive techniques compatible with high-throughput
analysis required for routine screenings. Using immu-
nocapture techniques, combining antibodies against
tetraspanins and candidate tumour-specific markers
we have recently optimized several assays that greatly
facilitate EV characterization.
Methods: We have improved flow cytometry and
ELISA assays, increasing substantially the sensitivity
for EV detection. Using DLS, EM and analytical ultra-
centrifugation, we have characterised the biophysical
basis of this enhancement. The final methodology can
be performed in any laboratory with access to conven-
tional flow cytometry or ELISA reader.
Results: Using combinations of antibodies specific for
the tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81, it is possible to
detect EVs in minimal volumes of urine and plasma
samples without previous enrichment. Additionally
antibodies against other less abundant markers, like
the epithelial marker EpCAM, have been used to cap-
ture and identify EVs directly in minimal volumes of
urine or plasma with sensitivity higher than Western
Blot analysis of isolated EVs. Furthermore, we demon-
strate that additives altering the biophysical properties
of an EV suspension, increased detection of tumour
antigens in these immune-assays.
Summary/Conclusion: The development of sensitive,
high-throughput methods, easily translatable to clinical
settings, as ELISA and flow cytometry described here,
opens a new avenue for the systematic identification of
any surface marker on EVs, even scarce proteins, using
very small volumes of minimally processed biological
samples. These methods will allow the validation of EV
biomarkers in routine liquid biopsy tests.

breast cancer cell lines

Introduction: When EV subpopulations are enriched
on antibody microarrays and probed for their surface
proteins, the detection signal is biased towards abundant
subpopulations as it is dependent on both the protein
expression level and the number of EVs captured. To
address this challenge, we developed a novel normal-
ization approach allowing: 1) the estimation of a target
signal independent of EV subpopulation size through
dye-based EV quantification, and 2) the assessment of
subpopulation target enrichment relative to the popula-
tion average by leveraging TIM4 as an unbiased, lipid-
based EV capture. Here, we investigated the expression
of cancer-associated proteins, particularly metastasis-
associated integrins (ITGs), in breast cancer EVs with
varying metastatic potential and organotropism.
Methods: The relative protein enrichment profiles for
various EV subpopulations were established from EVs
of SkBr3 (HER2+), T47D and MCF-7 (ER+PR+),
BT549 and MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) breast can-
cer cell lines, as well as five MDA-MB-231-derived cell
lines of four different organotropisms (brain, bone,
lung, liver) using our custom antibody microarrays
with our normalization approach.
Results: As expected, HER2 was broadly detected in
HER2+ SkBr3 EVs. Interestingly, HER2- T47D and
MCF-7 EVs also expressed HER2 where it was highly
enriched in its EpCAM+ subpopulations. ITG α6, β3
and β4 were only found in triple negative and organo-
tropic EVs with ITG β3 and β4 differentially enriched
based on the organotropism. The population average of
MDA-MB-231 and lung-tropic EVs had high expression
of ITG β4, where subpopulations of CD44+ EVs showed
positive enrichment while CD9+ and CD63+ EVs showed
negative enrichment. ITG α5, β3 and β4 were absent in
the bone-tropic CD81+ EV subpopulation, a profile aty-
pical in other organotropisms. Lastly, EGFR was nega-
tively enriched in Tetraspanin+ subpopulations in MDA-
MB-231 EVs, but positively enriched in these subpopula-
tions in organotropic EVs, especially for brain-tropism.
Summary/Conclusion: Following normalization, we
were able to quantify specific protein associations,
uncovering a multitude of co-enrichment profiles that
characterize specific metastatic and organotropic cell
lines. Notably, we found enrichment signatures that
distinguish between different organotropisms derived
from the same parental cancer line.

cancer and non-cancer cells is essential for tumour
growth and progression. We have previously shown
that heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs), on the
surface of prostate cancer EVs, are required for delivery
of TGFβ and initiation of a disease-supporting fibro-
blast phenotype. However, HSPGs are known to bind
numerous growth factors, so here we have explored the
repertoire of such proteins tethered to EVs by HSPGs.
Methods: EVs were isolated from DU145 prostate cancer
cell conditioned media by ultra-centrifugation onto a
sucrose cushion. Vesicular HSPGs were modified either
by removal of heparan sulphate (HS) glycosaminoglycan
(GAG) chains using the enzyme Heparinase III (HEPIII),
or attenuation of HSPG core protein expression using
shRNAs to knockdown specific HSPGs within the parent
cell. Differences in proteins present in control vs mod-
ified EVs were identified by a sensitive protein array,
based on proximity-ligation technology, and selected tar-
gets validated by ELISA. Functional delivery of growth
factors by EV-associated HSPGs to recipient fibroblasts is
being explored using a variety of in vitro techniques.
Results: Proteome analysis identified 49 targets that
bind to HS-GAG chains, and also 108 different pro-
teins that showed altered expression following the loss
of one or more HSPGs from EVs. Using ELISA, we
have been able to quantify selected candidates on wild
type vesicles, some of these are lost following HS-
digestion. We were also able to validate proteins on
HSPG-deficient vesicles. Gene ontology analysis sug-
gests that EV HSPG-mediated delivery of growth fac-
tors is important for control of processes such as
angiogenesis, tumour invasion and immune regula-
tion. Functional validation of proteins identified is
ongoing.
Summary/Conclusion: Here we demonstrate that
HSPGs play a key role in loading of EVs with a
complex assortment of growth factors, and there-
fore subsequent EV-mediated growth factor deliv-
ery. We anticipate that loss or damage of EV-
associated HSPGs will result in attenuation of EV
induction
of
a
tumour-supporting
fibroblast
phenotype.

Introduction: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth lead-
ing cause of cancer-related death in women, partly
due to difficulty in early diagnosis. Extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) show promise for use in early diagnostics
of OC. Here, EVs from cervical mucus (CM) of
ovarian cancer patients were used for discovery of
OC biomarkers for diagnostics. Machine learning
was used to mine EV miRNA data to develop an
OC biomarker panel (validation via The Cancer
Genome Atlas). Examination of the miRNA targets
reveal that the panel is a sufficiently accurate pre-
dictor of OC.
Methods: EVs from the CM of 48 patients (15 high-
grade serous, 24 low-grade, 7 benign) were isolated for
small RNA-sequencing. The top differentially expressed
miRNAs were used in a random forest and “voom”
(variance modelling at the observational level) model.
Unsupervised approaches were used and then vetted
against patient symptomology data. A TCGA ovarian
cancer dataset (n = 100) was used for validation.
Results: An OC biomarker panel of 10 microRNAs
(voom: 96.55% accuracy; random forest: 88% accu-
racy) was generated. The panel consists of members
from the mir-200 family and the mir-16 family,
among others. The miRNA targets are associated
with molecular functions and pathways specific in
OC progression.
Summary/Conclusion: Our method has identified EV
miRNA biomarkers that may be crucial for early, non-
invasive detection of OC. Data science has been used to
develop a feedback system integrating biochemical
experiments, smaller datasets, and previously available
data to identify and verify a biomarker panel for OC
diagnostics.

Introduction: Methamphetamine (MA) and related
amphetamine compounds, which are potent psychosti-
mulants, are among the most commonly used illicit
drugs.
Neuroimaging
studies
have
revealed
that
chronic MA abuse can indeed cause neurodegenerative
changes in the brains of human MA abusers including
prominent microglial activation throughout the brain.
It is still unclear how chronic inflammation caused by
MA abuse leads to long-term damage to the brain.
With this in mind, we are particularly interested in
studying the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in eli-
citing chronic inflammation in MA exposed brains. In
the present study, we focus on the role of a miRNA,
miR-29a-3p (miR-29a) in chronic MA exposure. Here,
we present novel data that shows for the first time how
chronic MA impacts not only the biogenesis but also
the EV associated miRNA cargo thereby affecting the
overall health of the neurons and glial cells in the brain.
Methods: – Density gradient centrifugation for isola-
tion of Brain-derived Vesicles
- Characterization of BDEs by Western Blotting,
Nanoparticle tracking analysis and Transmission
Electron Microscopy
- Quantitative RT-PCR
- Digital droplet PCR
- Confocal Imaging of dendritic spines and synapses
Results: In the present study, we show from both in
vivo and in vitro studies that chronic methampheta-
mine
(MA)
treatment
alters
EV
biogenesis
and
microRNA (miRNA) cargo. Brain-derived EVs (BDE)
isolated from frontal grey tissue of rhesus macaques
that were administered MA in a chronic regimen
revealed a significant increase in both number and
size. Further analysis revealed increase in biogenesis
genes and increased levels of miRNA, miR-29a-3p
(miR-29a). In situ hybridization of the frontal brain
area revealed that miR-29a was exclusively expressed in
microglia and neurons. Further, in vitro studies
revealed that EV associated miR-29a elicited not only
neuronal damage but also was able to activate micro-
glia to release pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby
inducing a chronic inflammatory cycle. Finally, we
show that an anti-inflammatory drug was able to res-
cue inflammation, miR-29a levels and synaptodendritic
injury.
Summary/Conclusion:
In
summary,
our
results
present for the first time show that chronic MA
exposure in the brain affects EV biogenesis and
miRNA expression. We further confirm that miR-
29a can serve as potential marker to diagnose
synaptic
deficits
for
chronic
MA
addiction
in
humans. Finally, we reveal that anti-inflammatory
drug could rescue the EV biogenesis and reduces
the secretion of miR-29a, thereby rescues synapto-
dendritic injury. Our data further supports the use
of the anti-inflammatory drugs as therapeutic inter-
ventions for MA addiction.

development, so we hypothesized that pro-inflamma-
tory extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role.
Methods: EVs with opioid administration were assayed
in mice and humans. Annexin V-positive, 0.1–1 µm
diameter microparticles (MPs) were assessed by flow
cytometry in murine and human blood and in murine
deep cervical lymph nodes that drain brain glympha-
tics. Blood-borne exosomes (<100 nm) were assayed by
tunable-resistance pulse sensing (TRPS). Anti-nocicep-
tive tolerance following morphine administration to
mice was assessed by speed of tail removal from
warm water.
Results: Repetitive morphine dosing of mice to induce
anti-nociceptive tolerance increased blood-borne MPs
by eightfold, and by tenfold in cervical lymph nodes.
MPs expressed proteins specific to neutrophils, micro-
glia, astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. IL-1β
content of MPs increased 68-fold. Administration of
an IL-1β antagonist to mice diminished blood and
glymphatic MPs elevations and abrogated tolerance
induction. Intravenous polyethylene glycol Telomer B
that lyses MPs and intraperitoneal methylnaltrexone
that binds peripheral opioid-mu receptors and myeloid
differentiation factor-2 to inhibit toll-like receptors,
inhibited MPs elevations and tolerance. Neutropenic
mice did not develop anti-nociceptive tolerance, eleva-
tions of blood-borne MPs or cervical node MPs expres-
sing microglial proteins. Elevations of blood-borne
exosomes were not identified based on TRPS analysis.
Patients entering treatment for opioid use disorder
exhibited similar MPs elevations as do tolerant mice.
Summary/Conclusion: Neutrophil-derived MPs con-
taining IL-1β are required for morphine-induced anti-
nociceptive tolerance.

EVs are a conveyor of toxic dipeptide repeat proteins in C9orf72 ALS/
FTD models
Maria Elena Cicardi and Davide Trotti
Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA
Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of
motor neurons. In ALS, motor symptoms initiate
focally and then progress gradually, distal from the
initial focus. Abnormal forms of ALS-associated pro-
teins are physically exchanged between neuronal cells.
Pathogenic ALS proteins like SOD1, FUS and TDP43
are transmitted between cells by assisted mechanisms,
mainly extracellular vesicles (EVs), spreading toxicity
and misfolding of native proteins within the recipient
cells. An intronic G4C2 aberrant nucleotide repeat
expansion in C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic
cause of ALS. Translation of this expanded region
occurs by a process called repeat associated non-AUG
(RAN) translation that produces five dipeptide repeats
proteins (DPRs), polyGA, polyGP, polyGR, polyPA
and polyGA. PolyGA, polyGR and polyPR are asso-
ciated with toxicity in neurons. In this work we study
the recruitment of these aberrant proteins into extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) and the potential role of these
EVs in spreading toxicity between cells of the central
nervous system.
Methods: To isolate the EVs from cell culture media
we isolated by ultracentrifugation the larger vesicles at
21,000xg and the smaller EVs at 100,000xg. Number,
size and fluorescence of the vesicles were analysed by
fluorescent
nanotrack
analysis
(F-NTA)
and
by
Cytoflex. The protein content of the vesicles was ana-
lysed by western blot (WB). To evaluate the potential
toxicity of the EVs, a transwell system (TW) was
employed. Neuron viability was assessed using live
imaging techniques.
Results: NSC34 were transfected with reporter con-
structs expressing DPRs tagged with GFP protein. By
F-NTA, Cytoflex and WB analysis we assessed that all
the five DPRs were loaded in both the large and the
small vesicles isolated from cell culture medium. By
TW, NSC34 transfected with the DPRs were put in
contact with primary cortical neurons (CNs) trans-
fected with synapsin driven Td-Tomato for live ima-
ging purposes. We observed that polyGR+ NSC34
were able to cause a significant decrease in CNs via-
bility. We also observed that polyGR+ EVs associated
toxicity was directly dependent on polyGR length.
This effect was reverted reducing the number of
polyGR+ EVs treating NSC34 with GW4869. To
understand the downstream effect of polyGR+ EVs
in recipient cells we studied TDP43 mislocalization,
RAN-translation and activation of the integrated
stress response, finding a dysregulation of all these
potentially toxic pathways in neurons treated with
polyGR+ vesicles.
Summary/Conclusion: Concluding, DPRs are actively
secreted in EVs and polyGR+ vesicles cause the activa-
tion of toxic mechanisms in the recipient cells, possibly
contributing to the spreading of ALS.

Introduction: Pregnancy is the a condition that pro-
foundly mitigates symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)
a complex disease characterized by immune dysfunc-
tion and neurodegeneration affecting 2.3 million peo-
ple worldwide. Serum exosomes, released by specific
cells during pregnancy, modulate the immune and
central nervous system function and contribute to
pregnancy-associated
suppression
of
experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an induced pre-
clinical model of MS. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
the new means for communication among cells. The
aim of our study was to characterize the ability of
Human
Amniotic
Fluid
Stem
Cells-derived
EVs
(HASC-EVs) to antigen presenting cell function thus
correcting immune dysfunction in EAE.
Methods: Amniotic Fluids were obtained from human
16–17-week pregnant women. HASC-EVs were col-
lected by ultra-centrifugation. EVs were characterized
for their specific proteins, lipids and nucleic acids
expression. The ability of EVs to modulate immune
responses was performed in vitro, testing the ability
of EVs to induce a tolerogenic phenotype in mouse
bone marrow derived dendritic cells, and in vivo for
their potential to suppress EAE, induced by immuniza-
tion C57/B6 female mice with MOG35-55 peptide.
Results: We found that HASC-EVs expressed high
levels of Galectin-1 and promoted a significant increase
of the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase-1 enzyme in DCs. Moreover in in vivo
experiments administration of HASC-EVs significantly
reduced disease severity in EAE. Such effect was asso-
ciated with reduced neurological deficits and suppres-
sion of pathogenic T helper 17 (Th17) cells, and
increased percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg-
Foxp3+) cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings unravel immu-
noregulatory effects of EVs secreted by HASCs. EVs
may represent a novel cell-free immune regulatory and
regenerative therapeutic approach that can potentially
mitigate
immune
dysfunction
and
promote
remyelination.

Introduction: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is character-
ized by a long preclinical stage during which phos-
phorylated Tau pathology spreads in the brain leading
to clinical symptoms. Pathogenic Tau spreads, in part,
via Extracellular vesicles (EVs). We and others have
demonstrated that Tau cargoes of neuronal-derived
EVs (nEVs) from blood can serve as biomarkers for
AD. We aimed to examine whether nEV Tau cargo
can predict cognitive decline in late middle age by
leveraging
samples
from
participants
in
the
Wisconsin
Registry
for
Alzheimer’s
Prevention
(WRAP) study.
Methods: We blindly immunoprecipitated nEVs using
antibody against neuronal L1 cell adhesion molecule
(L1CAM) from serum samples of 146 WRAP partici-
pants who were cognitively unimpaired at baseline
(mean age 62.4 ± 6.3 years old; 71.2% females; 42.5%
APOE4 carriers), of whom half subsequently developed
cognitive decline. We measured phosphorylated (p181
and p231) and total Tau in nEVs using electrochemi-
luminescence assays. We used linear regression models
to identify differences between cognitive status groups
including age, sex ApoE status and the cognitive sta-
tus*age interaction in the model.
Results: At baseline, we found trends for higher p181-
(p = 0.07) and p231-Tau (p = 0.05) levels in future
decliners compared to stable participants. Further,
there were significant cognitive status*age interactions
for pTau231 (p < 0.01), total Tau (p < 0.001) and
pTau181 (p < 0.05) with higher levels with increasing
age in future decliners
Summary/Conclusion: nEV Tau cargo differs between
late middle-aged individuals at risk for AD with and
without future cognitively decline even before decline
occurs, presumably due to subclinical spread of Tau

Introduction: In the brain, circulating extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contain a
variety of signalling factors, including proteins, enzymes,
and RNA transcripts. While EVs have been implicated
in many cell-to-cell signalling contexts, the vast majority
of these studies are based on findings derived from cell
culture conditions. Thus, the ability to identify cell type-
specific EV release from cellular subpopulations within
the brain represents a critical barrier in the field.
Methods: To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a
novel transgenic mouse model to determine the release of
cell-type specific EVs. Here we report the ExoMap-2
mouse, which is designed to express an exosomal green
fluorescent protein in response to expression of Cre recom-
binase. Specifically, the ExoMap-2 transgene was inserted
at the mouse H11 locus and consists of (i) a broadly
expressed CAG promoter/enhancer, (ii) a floxed ORF
encoding MTS-tdTomato, (iii) an ORF encoding the exo-
somal proteinAcylTyA fused to mNeonGreen(mNG),and
(iv) a 3ʹ UTR containing the WPRE element and polyade-
nylation signal from the bovine growth hormone gene.
Results: Intracranial ventricular injections of the viral
vector AAV-TTR-Cre, which drives Cre recombinase
expression from the choroid plexus-specific promotor
of the transthyretin gene, leads to AcylTyA-mNG
expression
in
the
choroid
plexus.
Moreover,
we
observed that these mice released mNeonGreen-posi-
tive EVs into the cerebrospinal fluid and also visualized
the vesicles in the blood. Furthermore, these mice dis-
played an accumulation of AcylTyA-mNG fluorescence
in the medial habenula.
Summary/Conclusion: The results indicate that chor-
oid plexus-derived EVs are trafficked to the CSF and the
medial habenula, and more generally, that the ExoMap-
2 mouse can be used to follow the trafficking of tissue-
specific EVs into biofluids and between tissues in vivo.

Extracellular vesicles containing oncogenic mutant β-catenin activate Wnt
signalling pathway in the recipient cells

Introduction: Large-scale colorectal cancer (CRC)
sequencing studies have shown that 93% of all tumours
had at least one mutation in proteins implicated in the
Wnt signalling pathway. Mutations in
β-catenin have often been associated with the con-
stitutive activation of Wnt signalling pathway and has
been established as a major driver of CRC. One of the
proposed mechanisms of activating Wnt signalling
involves extracellular vesicles (EVs) as cellular couriers
to transfer Wnt ligands from one cell to another.
However, the association of oncogenic mutant β-cate-
nin with EVs has not been studied. Subpopulations of
cancer cells with different mutational loads and beha-
vioural variations lead to intra-tumour heterogeneity
Methods: Integrative proteogenomic analysis showed
the secretion of mutant β-catenin via EVs. EVs were
isolated by ultracentrifugation and OptiPrep density
gradient centrifugation. SILAC-based quantitative pro-
teomics analysis, immunofluorescence, biochemical
analysis, qPCR and xenograft models were employed
to unveiling the role of EVs carrying mutant β-
catenin.
Results: An integrative proteogenomic analysis identi-
fied the presence of mutated β-catenin in EVs secreted
by colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Follow up experi-
ments established that EVs released from LIM1215
CRC cells stimulated Wnt signalling pathway in the
recipient cells with wild type β-catenin. SILAC-based
quantitative proteomics analysis confirmed the transfer
of mutant β-catenin to the nucleus of the recipient
(RKO CRC) cells. In vivo tracking of DiR labelled
EVs in mouse implanted with RKO CRC cells revealed
its bio distribution, confirmed the activation of Wnt
signalling pathway in tumour cells and increased the
tumour burden.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, for the first time, this
study reveals that EVs can transfer mutant β-catenin to
the recipient cells and promote cancer progression.

Introduction: There has been a significant increase in
incidence of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) driven
oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) in developed countries.
There is evidence that HPV alters the molecular cargo
of exosomes released by OPC. Emerging evidence sug-
gests that HPV integration within the human genome
is associated with both genomic and transcriptomic
alterations. Consistent with previous studies, the geno-
mic viral–cellular junctions were identified using DIPS-
PCR method in 15 (88%) saliva samples collected from
HPV16-driven OPC.
Methods: Morphology and molecular features of exo-
somes derived from three different saliva sampling
methods: unstimulated saliva; acid-stimulated saliva;
and
salivary
oral
rinses
were
examined
using
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparti-
cle tracking (NTA) and western blot analysis. HPV-16
DNA detection in salivary exosome was determined by
using qPCR method. Proteome profile of salivary exo-
somes derived from both cancer-free controls and
HPV16-driven OPC patients was characterized using
liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Results: We demonstrate that unstimulated saliva had
greater abundance of exosomes when compared to the
other sampling methods. Three common exosome
markers (CD9, CD63 and CD81) were higher in unsti-
mulated saliva. Only salivary exosomes derived from
HPV-driven OPC patients had a detectable level of
HPV-16 DNA. The proteomic signature of salivary

cancer-free controls and HPV-driven OPC. We found
elevated protein abundance of five main glycolytic
enzymes (i.e. Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 (PGK1),
Glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
Aldolase (ALDOA) and Lactate dehydrogenase A
(LDHA) in salivary exosomes derived from OPC
patients,
suggesting
a
functional
role
of
salivary
exosome in the reciprocal interplay between HPV-dri-
ven OPC and glucose metabolism.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that the devel-
opment of a low-cost non-invasive saliva-based test
using both salivary exosomal DNA and protein may
offer an opportunity to detect HPV-driven OPC, that
may be clinically useful in managing these patients.

Introduction: Mast cells are important players of the
immune system and they secrete a wide range of med-
iators during bacterial infections. Mast cells are also
able to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here, we
report that mast cells communicate with each other
in vivo by EVs.
Methods: We isolated bone marrow-derived and peri-
toneal mast cells from GFP-transgenic and wild type
mice. EVs were separated from the conditioned media
of these cells cultured in the presence or absence of
lipopolysaccharide
(LPS).
EVs
were
characterised
according to the MISEV2018 guidelines by flow cyto-
metry, electron and fluorescent microscopy, TRPS, the
SPV lipid and the BCA protein assays. Separated EV-s
were cultured with naïve mast cells, and tumour necro-
sis factor (TNF)-α production was tested by ELISA and
intracellular flow cytometry. GFP+ mast cells were
seeded in diffusion chambers which were implanted
into the peritoneal cavities of mice enabling us to
investigate the continuous in vivo release of EVs.
Uptake of GFP+ EVs and TNF-α expression of perito-
neal mast cells were tested by flow cytometry and
fluorescent microscopy.
Results: Here, we showed that bacterial LPS-sensing
mast cells release EVs that in turn, induce TNF-α
expression in resting MCs in vitro. Moreover, we con-
firmed that EVs are transmitted to other peritoneal
mast cells in vivo spreading the pro-inflammatory
response by inducing TNF-α secretion in peritoneal
mast cells.
Summary/Conclusion: EV communication between
members of the mast cell network, play an important
role in spreading and escalating pro-inflammatory
responses to immune stimuli. Our data may provide
an explanation how the relatively rare tissue resident
mast cells can play key roles in diseases such as auto-
immune arthritis.

Introduction: The ability of small extracellular vesicles
(sEVs)
to
reprogramme
cancer
cells
is
known.
Integrins, receptors for extracellular matrix proteins,
are
major
players
in
mediating
sEV
functions.
Previously, we have reported that the αVβ3 integrin is
detected in sEVs of prostate adenocarcinoma (PrCa)
cells and transferred into recipient cells in a paracrine
fashion; however, its role and expression have never
been explored in the most aggressive forms of PrCa,
such as neuroendocrine PrCa (NEPrCa). NEPrCa does
not express androgen receptor (AR) but does express
neuron-specific proteins, such as Aurora kinase A,
Synaptophysin and Neuron specific enolase, that acti-
vate pro-tumorigenic pathways independently from
the AR.

Methods: We isolated sEVs from PrCa C4-2B cells
using iodixanol density gradients and characterized
them by immunoblotting and ExoView. The experi-
ments were performed in vivo by injecting subcuta-
neously, in nude mice, DU145 cells treated with sEVs
expressing or lacking the αVβ3 integrin, and in vitro,
by testing anchorage-independent growth of different
cell lines treated with the same sEVs. Discarded human
tissues from PrCa metastasis were analysed by immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC).
Results: We demonstrate that a single treatment of
PrCa cells with sEVs significantly stimulates tumour
growth and anchorage-independent growth. Moreover,
we show that one treatment with sEVs, shed from C4-
2B cells that express αVβ3, but not from the control
cells that lack αVβ3, induces differentiation of PrCa
cells towards a neuroendocrine phenotype and down-
regulates AR. Finally, our IHC analysis shows co-
expression of αVβ3 integrin and Synaptophysin in
NEPrCa metastatic lesions.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, our current
study shows, for the first time, that αVβ3 integrin
expression in donor cells generates sEVs that repro-
gramme recipient cells towards an aggressive tumour
phenotype.

School of Medicine, Nashville, USA
Introduction: Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles
(SEVs) that carry a variety of cargoes and have been
shown to promote tumour cell motility and metastasis.
Cell motility is influenced by dynamic formation and
stability of filopodia: actin-rich protrusions that extend
from the leading edge and perform directional sensing.
Filopodia regulators such as fascin are upregulated in
multiple epithelial cancers and can promote invasive
phenotypes. However, how filopodia are induced and
controlled by extracellular factors is poorly understood.
Here, we describe a role for SEVs in regulating filopo-
dia formation and tumour cell motility.
Methods: We utilized B16F1 melanoma cells and
HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells for fixed- and live-cell ima-
ging to quantify filopodia numbers and dynamics in
control and exosome-deplete conditions. iTRAQ pro-
teomics was used to identify SEV protein cargoes that
contribute to filopodia formation. In vivo experiments
were performed using a chick embryo model for
metastasis.
Results: Inhibition of exosome secretion in cancer cell
lines, via Rab27a or Hrs knockdown, led to decreased
filopodia numbers. Specificity to SEVs was demon-
strated by rescue experiments in which purified SEVs
but not large EVs rescued the filopodia phenotypes of
exosome-inhibited cells. Live imaging of Hrs-KD cells
revealed that exosome secretion regulates formation
and stability of filopodia. Proteomics data and molecu-
lar validation experiments identified the TGF-beta cor-
eceptor endoglin as a key SEV cargo regulating
filopodia
formation,
cancer
cell
motility,
and
metastasis.
Summary/Conclusion: In this study, we identified exo-
somal endoglin as a regulator of filopodia formation
and in vivo metastasis. These data are relevant to
cancer as endoglin expression is altered in many can-
cers. In addition, endoglin is the disease gene for her-
editary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, and may influence
angiogenesis. Overall, our data implicate SEV-carried
endoglin as a key cargo regulating filopodia.

Introduction: The breach of the Blood-brain barrier
(BBB), resulting in ensuing neuroinflammation, is a key
feature
of
HIV-associated
neurological
disorders
(HANDs). While combination antiretroviral therapy
(cART) has successfully suppressed peripheral viraemia,
cytotoxicity associated with the presence of viral Tat pro-
tein in tissues such as the brain, remains a significant
concern. Our previous study has demonstrated that
HIV-1 Tat can induce disruption of BBB by downregula-
tion of tight junction (TJ) proteins in Human Brain
Microvascular Endothelial cells (HBMECs) and that this
is regulated by the autophagic pathways.
Methods: EVs were isolated from HIV Tat-stimulated
mouse/human primary astrocytes using the standard
differential ultracentrifugation method and character-
ized by transmission electron microscopy, NanoSight &

western blot analyses. Among the various miRs dysre-
gulated in HIV Tat -stimulated astrocyte EV cargo,
miR-7 was found to be upregulated by realtime PCR.
Confocal microscopy identified uptake of astrocytic
EVs by HBMECs. Functional assessment of astrocytic
EV uptake by HBMECs involved cell permeability
using transepithelial electrical resistance as well as
trans-well
endothelial
cell
monolayer
permeability
assays.
Results: HIV-1 protein Tat-mediated induction of
microRNAs (miRs) in astrocyte-derived extracellular
vesicles (ADEVs) regulated the permeability of BBB
by targeting the expression of TJ proteins in the
HBMECs.
Exposure
of
HBMECs
to
Tat-ADEVs
resulted in down-regulation of the tight junction pro-
tein Claudin 5, resulting in increased endothelial cell
monolayer paracellular permeability. Microarray data
of Tat-ADEVs demonstrated upregulation of several
miRs compared to that of controls, among which upre-
gulated miR-7 was identified to target the TJ proteins
using ingenuity pathways analysis. Increased expres-
sion of miR-7 was validated in Tat exposed astrocytes
and Tat-ADEVs. ADEVs loaded with miR-7 oligos
showed similar effects as that observed with Tat-
ADEVs
in
inducing
permeability
in
HBMECs.
Increased expression of miR-7 with downregulation
of claudin-5 was also recapitulated in microvessels iso-
lated from the brains of Doxycycline-inducible HIV-1
Tat transgenic mice (iTat) mice and in lysates isolated
from the frontal cortices of SIV+ macaques/HIV+
autopsied brains.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
findings
demonstrated
that Tat-ADEVs containing miR-7 as an important

underlying

sition of engineered extracellular vesicles

Introduction:
Endogenous
exosomes
and
related
extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potent nanoparticles
released by all cells tested to date. The exploitation of
their unique scaffolding for engineering next-genera-
tion drug delivery systems represents a major area of
academic and commercial interest. The lag in exploit-
ing this potential is in part due to our inability to
measured extent and efficiency of modification, e.g.,
composition and drug loading. Here we report a robust
pipeline of optical tweezing combined with Raman
spectroscopy to molecularly characterize engineered
EVs and quantitatively assess extent of drug loading
at single particle resolution.
Methods: EVs derived from cell culture and isolated by
ultracentrifugation were fused with synthetic liposomes
to create engineered EVs (eEVs). These eEVs were
formed via well-established vesicle fusion techniques,
namely (1) mechanical extrusion, (2) freeze-thawing, or
(3) probe-tip sonication. Prior to formation, calcein
was encapsulated in the liposomes and used as a sur-
rogate for soluble drug loading. Laser trapping Raman
spectroscopy (LTRS) was used to optically trap single
EVs, before and after synthetic manipulation. Raman
spectral analysis was used to assess trapped eEVs com-
pared to pure standards to quantify ratiometric varia-
tion in chemical composition.
Results: Raman laser trapping experiments confirmed
that each formation method results in largely varying
(1) extent of fusion between EVs and synthetic calcein-
loaded liposomes, (2) efficiency of calcein loading, and
(3) particle size. We could also quantify the molar
amounts of liposome vs. EV molecules for single par-
ticles, revealing a great amount of variation from par-
ticle to particle. Functional membrane proteins we left
intact to varying degree across fusion methods.
Summary/Conclusion: Given the rising importance of
analytical tools able to characterize extent of molecular
loading for engineered EVs, we believe this technology
will be very useful, thus warrants further investigation
for eEV characterization across a variety of clinical
applications.

Zika virus infection of foetuses in pregnant mice through trans-placenta
delivery
Allen Z. Wu

Introduction: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can lead
to neurological complications and foetal defects, and
has attracted global public health concerns. Effective
treatment for ZIKV infection remains elusive and a
preventative
vaccine
is
not
available
yet.
Therapeutics for foetus need to overcome blood
brain barriers to reach placenta and require higher
safety standard.
Methods: In the present study, we engineered mam-
malian extracellular vesicles (EVs) to deliver a host
restrictive factor, interferon-induced transmembrane
protein 3 (IFITM3), for the treatment of ZIKV
infection.
Results: Our results demonstrated that the engi-
neered IFITM3-containing EVs (IFITM3-Exos) were
overall safe to the animals and suppressed ZIKV
viraemia
by
2
log10
s
in
the
pregnant
mice.
Moreover, the engineered EVs effectively delivered
IFITM3 protein across placental barrier and sup-
pressed overall ZIKV viraemia in the foetuses to
the basal level with significant reduction of viraemia
in
key
foetal
organs
as
measured
by
Q-PCR.
Mechanistic study showed that IFITM3 was delivered
to the endosomes/lysosomes where it inhibits viral
entry to the host cells.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are natural
and abundant nanoparticles capable of transferring
complex molecules between neighbouring and distant
cell types. Translational research efforts have focused
on co-opting this communication mechanism to deli-
ver exogenous payloads to treat a variety of diseases.
Important
strategies to maximize
the therapeutic
potential of EVs include payload loading, functionali-
zation of the EV surface with pharmacologically active
proteins, and delivery to target cells of interest.
Methods: Through comparative proteomic analysis
(LC/MS) of purified EVs, we identified several highly
enriched and EV-specific proteins, including a trans-
membrane glycoprotein (PTGFRN) belonging to the
immunoglobulin superfamily. Leveraging PTGFRN as
a scaffold for surface display, we generated EVs with
functional targeting ligands, including single domain
antibodies (sdAbs), single chain variable fragments
(scFvs), single chain Fabs (scFabs), and receptor
ligands, on the surface to direct EV uptake to cell
types of interest. Biological activity of these engineered
EVs was assessed in an array of in vitro and in vivo
assays and compared to untargeted controls.
Results: We engineered EVs displaying anti-Clec9A
scFabs to target conventional type 1 dendritic cells
(cDC1s), anti-CD3 scFabs to target T cells, and CD40
ligand to target B cells. In mice, systemic administra-
tion of anti-Clec9A EVs resulted in a 75% increase in
the percentage of cDC1 cells that take up EVs over
controls. Anti-CD3 EVs resulted in both an increase in
the percentage of EV positive T cells (3.75 and 3-fold
for CD4+ and CD8+) and the number of EVs per cell
(15 and 7-fold for CD4+ and CD8+) in the blood.
Furthermore, in primary mouse dendritic cells, anti-
Clec9A EVs loaded with STING agonist achieved a 15-
fold greater pathway induction compared to untargeted
controls. Preliminary in vivo data suggest that anti-
Clec9A EVs reduce the required STING agonist dose
10-fold to achieve efficacy and induce anti-tumour
responses, compared to control EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: These results demonstrate the
potential of our EV engineering platform to generate
novel EV therapeutics targeted to cell types of interest
for pharmacologic payload delivery.

Augusto Zani
The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada
Introduction: Antenatal cell-based therapies are cur-
rently considered invasive for the foetus. A promising
cell-free strategy that holds great regenerative potential
for several organs is the administration of stem cell
derived EVs, whose cargo contains bioactive molecules
that epigenetically regulate target cells. Herein, we
aimed to 1) assess the ability of EVs to reach foetal
organs when administered to the mother intravenously
or intra-amniotically; 2) compare these administration
routes on normal foetuses and foetuses with a conge-
nital anomaly.
Methods: EVs were isolated from rat amniotic fluid
stem cell conditioned medium using ultracentrifuga-
tion. EVs were assessed for size (nanoparticle tracking
analysis), morphology (TEM), and expression of CD63,
Hsp70, Flo-1, and TSG101 (Western). We injected rat
dams with EVs stained by ExoGlow™-Vivo or saline
(control) via maternal tail vein (IV) or intra-amnioti-
cally (IA) at E20.5. IA and IV injections were per-
formed on dams carrying normal foetuses or foetuses
exposed to nitrofen to induce congenital diaphragmatic
hernia. After 24h, dams and pups were sacrificed. 3D
high-sensitivity optical reconstructions of whole foe-
tuses or micro-dissected foetal organs were imaged
using the IVIS® Spectrum imaging system. EV fluores-
cence signal was compared between normal (n = 27)
and nitrofen-exposed (n = 45) foetuses.
Results: Both IV and IA injection routes were successful
in delivering EVs to foetal organs. No fluorescent signal

was detected in saline only control. IA injections yielded
higher signal than IV, and EVs reached more organs with
IA than IV injections. IA injected EVs were detected in
the lungs, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract of normal
and nitrofen-exposed foetuses. Nitrofen exposed foetuses
had higher signal than normal foetuses.
Summary/Conclusion: This proof of concept study
shows that antenatal administration of stem cell EVs
is feasible with different routes. Although maternally
administered EVs cross the placenta, IA injection is
more effective at reaching foetal organs. Further studies
are underway to reproduce these findings in experi-
mental models of various congenital anomalies.

Introduction: Safe, efficient and specific nano-delivery
systems are essential to the current cosmetic, nutraceu-
tical and therapeutic medicine sectors. The ability to
optimise the bioavailability, stability, and targeted cel-
lular uptake of bioactive molecules while mitigating
toxicity, immunogenicity and off-target/side effects is
of the utmost priority. VES4US is a European project,
which aims to develop an innovative platform for the
efficient production of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from
microalgae, which constitute a promising renewable
bioresource (www.ves4us.eu). Here we present charac-
teristics of EVs from several microalgal lineages, which
offer the opportunity for a potentially developing a new
and scalable tailor-made biogenic nanotechnology.
Methods: We cultivated a number of EV-producing
microalgal species and developed protocols for EV
isolation both at laboratory (differential ultracentrifuga-
tion) and pilot scales (tangential flow filtration). The phy-
sico-chemical characterization of microalgal EVs was
carried out according to the minimal information for stu-
dies of extracellular vesicles 2018 (MISEV-2018 guide-
lines): biochemical methods to verify the presence of
specific
EV-biomarkers,
tuned
for
microalgal
EVs;
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA) to assess the particles number and size
distribution; electronic
scanning
microscopy (SEM),
atomic force microscopy (AFM), and cryo transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) for imaging analyses;
bilayer-specific fluorescence staining (F-NTA) to test the
purity of EV preparation.
Results: We identified microalgae as a novel natural
source of EVs that could constitute a cost-effective and
sustainable way of mass-producing them. We screened
20 strains of microalgae and generated an “EV Identity
Card” for each, which contained a variety of EV fea-
tures relating to their biophysical, biochemical and
biological characteristics in line with the MISEV-
2018. Our approach will next focus on the scalable
production, surface functionalization and bio-engi-
neering of selected microalgal EVs. At the same time,
their bioactivity will be explored using both in vitro
and in vivo biological models.
Summary/Conclusion: The VES4US consortium is
investigating the potential of microalgae as novel EV
bioresources. This research will attempt to bioengineer
novel naturally-derived nanocarriers, microalgal EVs,
suitable for the development of future cosmetics,
nutraceutical or therapeutic formulations.

Several sequences have been identified that act as a
zipcode for preferential RNA targeting into EV (EV-
tropic) or for retention in parental cells (cell-tropic). In
this work, we aimed to compare the EV-tropic capacity
of specific RNA sequence motifs in promoting loading
into EV, across different cell models representing the
main cell types found in the body.
Methods: Immune, epithelial and mesenchymal cell
lines were transiently transfected with xenogeneic C.
elegans microRNAs (miRNAs) containing EV-tropic
or cell-tropic sequences and grown in culture. EV were
isolated from the supernatant by differential (ultra)cen-
trifugation. RNA was extracted from both cell pellets
and isolated EV fraction, and target miRNAs were
quantified by digital droplet PCR. Distribution of
cargo miRNA across cells and EV was also analysed
for chimeras of EV- and cell-tropic sequences.
Results:
The
miRNAs
containing
an
EV-tropic
sequence were highly enriched on the EV fraction,
with 1000–10,000 higher levels than in parental cells.
Contrarily, cell-tropic miRNAs were only 10–100 times
higher in EV. No significant differences were observed
in the EV loading efficiency for the various EV-tropic
motifs tested. Mutations in the EV-sorting motif
resulted in reduced EV loading. EV-tropic sequences
consistently promoted miRNA loading into EV across
all the cell models evaluated, suggesting conserved
biological mechanisms.
Summary/Conclusion: We showed that RNA loading
into EV is dependent on the presence of defined EV-
tropic RNA motifs, and that sorting mechanisms are
conserved across the major cell types tested. The high-
est loading efficiencies resulted in 0.001 miRNA
copies per particle on average, suggesting a limited
scope for EV-tropic motifs for therapeutic RNA load-
ing into EV.

Introduction: Coordinated activity between pancreatic
islet cells is critical for the regulation of glucose homo-
eostasis. Chronic exposure to diabetogenic factors such
as pro-inflammatory cytokines, perturb islet cell cross-
talk and β-cell function in diabetes. Extracellular vesi-
cles
(EVs)
derived
from
cytokine-exposed
β-cells
modulate physiological and pathological responses to
β-cell stress. However, the mechanisms governing this
process remain largely unknown. We set out to test the
hypothesis that β-cell failure in diabetes is mediated in
part through β-cell autocrine release of pro-inflamma-
tory EVs which promote inflammation and inhibit β-
cell function.
Methods:
Pro-inflammatory
cytokine-exposed
EVs
(cytoEVs) were generated using conditioned media
from mouse Min6 β-cell line treated with diabetogenic
cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ, 48h). EVs were also
isolated from human type 2 diabetic (T2DM) and
lean non-diabetics (LND) plasma. GW4869 (N-SMase
inhibitor) was used in the presence of cytokines to
determine the effect of reduced EV concentrations on
the restoration of β-cell function. Proteomic and RNA-
Seq analysis was conducted on Min6 β-cell cytoEV (vs.
control
EV)
and
cytoEV
treated
mouse
islets,
respectively.
Results:
Assessment
of
EV
concentrations
from
cytoEV and human T2DM plasma revealed a ~ twofold
increase (p < .05, vs. control (ctl) and LND EV).
Immunofluorescence
staining
of
CD9
and
CD63
expression was significantly elevated in human T2DM
pancreas (p < .05, vs. LND). While acute inhibition of
EV formation with GW4869 (5 µM) showed significant
restoration in β-cell function (glucose stimulated insu-
lin secretion assay, GSIS) in cytokine-exposed mouse
and human islets (~7 and 2 fold vs. cytokines alone,
p < .05). Moreover, functional assessment of mouse
islets exposed to cytoEV (48h) resulted in suppression
of GSIS (~55%, vs. untreated, p < .05). Identification of
cytoEV content through proteomic analysis revealed a
significant upregulation of the chemokine, CXCL10
(~40 fold vs. ctlEV) and RNA-Seq analysis of cytoEV
treated mouse islets depicted a marked upregulation of
transcripts associated with CXCL10-CXCR3 signalling
(p < .001) and downstream pathways (e.g. NFκB;
p = .016 and JAK/STAT; p = .021). Furthermore,
inhibition of cytoEV (GW4869) with cytokines mark-
edly decreased CXCL10 (~30%) and CXCR3 receptor
(~65%) expression in Min6 β-cells.
Summary/Conclusion: These data suggests that cyto-
kines elevate CXCL10 expression in β-cell EV to
enhance
inflammation-induced
diabetes.
This
is
mediated through EV-autocrine release of CXCL10
consequently activating CXCR3 signalling and down-
stream pathways to impair β-cell function in diabetes.

determined. Additionally, several enzymes, among
them 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) and secreted phospho-
lipase A2 (sPLA2) are induced during inflammation
and were suggested to promote DAMP formation.
Methods: StressEVs were produced from HEK293 cells
exposed to 10uM A23187 and isolated with ultracen-
trifugation. 20:4 lysoPI was oxidized for 10 min with
15-LO. Additionally, synEVs were prepared from phos-
pholipids (PLs), oxidized with 15-LO and hydrolysed
with sPLA2. Activity was measured by qPCR and
ELISA on wt and TLR4-KO macrophages. 15-LO oxi-
dized 20:4 lysoPI was analysed by mass spectrometry.
sPLA2 activity was measured in synovial fluid from
rheumatoid and gout patients using fluorometric
assay. K/BxN serum transfer induced arthritis model
on wt and TLR4 KO mice (C57Bl/6 mice) with sPLA2-
IIA injection was used (approval no. U34401-14/2019/8
by MKGP of Slovenia).
Results: StressEVs released after oxidative stress were
found to activate TLR4 with a gene profile different
from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). StressEVs, 15-
LO oxidized synEVs, but only 15-LO oxidized lysoPLs
activated cytokine expression through TLR4/MD-2.
Hydroxy, hydroperoxy and keto products of 20:4
lysoPI oxidation were determined by MS and they
activated
the
same
gene
pattern
as
stressEVs.
Furthermore, sPLA2 activity, which we detected in
the synovial fluid from patients, promoted formation
of TLR4 agonists after 15-LO oxidation. Injection of
sPLA2-IIA into mice promoted K/BxN serum induced
arthritis in TLR4-dependent manner.
Summary/Conclusion: Both 15-LO and sPLA2 are
induced during inflammation, therefore these results
imply the role of oxidized lysoPLs in stressEVs in
promoting sterile inflammation through TLR4 signal-
ling. The formation of TLR4 agonists is enzyme driven
so it provides an opportunity for therapy without com-
promising innate immunity against pathogens.

Monocytes traffic extracellular vesicles to damaged muscle and adopt a
novel immunophenotype to support muscle regeneration

Introduction:
Extracellular
vesicles
(EVs)
are
secreted membrane vesicles that carry bioactive
molecules such as miRNAs, mRNAs, proteins, and
lipids
to
modify
recipient
cell
behaviour.
We
recently
demonstrated
EVs
secreted
by
cardio-
sphere-derived cells (CDC-EVs) augment endogen-
ous muscle regeneration in mdx mice, a model of
Duchenne
muscular
dystrophy,
when
delivered
intravenously. In parallel, macrophages preferen-
tially accumulate surrounding small regenerating
myofibers
in
CDC-EV
treated
mdx
muscle.
However, it is currently unclear how intravenous
CDC-EVs home to dystrophic muscle and exert
their therapeutic bioactivity.
Methods: Fluorescently-labelled and unlabelled CDC-
EVs were infused into the contralateral femoral vein
of wild-type mice with unilateral muscle injury
induced by BaCl2. Injured and uninjured muscles
were dissected 24h following infusion and subjected
to optical imaging, immunohistochemistry, and con-
focal microscopy. This experiment was repeated using
clodronate liposomes to deplete endogenous mono-
cytes/macrophages. Next, RNA-seq was preformed on
bone
marrow-derived
M1,
M2,
and
CDC-EV
(MCDC-EV) polarized macrophages from mdx mice.
Conditioned media (CM) from these macrophages
were tested in an in vitro model of myogenesis.
Lastly, small RNA-seq was performed on EVs secreted
by M1, M2, and MCDC-EV macrophages.
Results:
When
delivered
intravenously,
CDC-EVs
naturally home to injured, but not uninjured, skeletal
muscle. CDC-EVs were detected in the interstitium
adjacent to non-muscle cells, macrophages, and within
surviving myofibers. After depletion of monocytes/
macrophages by clodronate liposomes, the presence of
CDC-EVs in the injured muscle was attenuated.
Bioinformatic analyses indicate CDC-EVs confer a
novel immunophenotype to mdx macrophages with
features of both M1 and M2. Indeed, MCDC-EV CM
promotes myoblast proliferation and supports myo-
genic differentiation. Interestingly, MCDC-EV EVs
have a unique miRNA signature and contain several
miRNAs with known roles in myogenesis.
Summary/Conclusion: These data indicate circulating
monocytes traffic CDC-EVs to damaged muscle where
they adopt a novel immunophenotype to support mus-
cle regeneration. We propose MCDC-EV macrophages
mediate their pleiotropic effects via paracrine factors,
possibly including EVs.

Introduction: Microglia, the immunocompetent cells
of the CNS, play an important role in maintaining
cellular homoeostasis in the CNS. These cells secrete
immunomodulatory factors including nanovesicles and
participate in the removal of cellular debris by phago-
cytosis or autophagy.
The contribution of microglial-derived extracellular
vesicles (M-EVs) to the maintenance of CNS homo-
eostasis is unclear. In addition, knowledge of canonical
signalling pathways of inflammation and immunity
gene expression patterns in human microglia exposed
to M-EVs is scarce.
Methods: Here, we analysed the effects of M-EVs pro-
duced in vitro by either TNFα-activated or non-stimu-
lated microglia BV2 cells. We showed that M-EVs are
internalized by both mouse BV2 and human C20
microglia and that the uptake of M-EVs in microglia
induced autophagic vesicles at various stages of degra-
dation including autophagosomes and autolysosomes.
Consistently,
exposure
of
microglia
to
M-EVs
increased the protein expression of the autophagy mar-
ker, LC3B-II, and promoted autophagic flux in live
cells. To elucidate the biological activities occurring at
the transcriptional level in C20 microglia exposed to
M-EVs,
the
gene
expression
profiles,
potential
upstream regulators, and enrichment pathways were
characterized using targeted RNA sequencing.
Results: Inflammation and immunity transcriptome
gene panel sequencing of both activated and normal
microglia exposed to M-EVs showed involvement of
several canonical pathways and reduced expression of
key genes involved in neuroinflammation, inflamma-
some and apoptosis signalling pathways compared to
control cells.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrate that in vitro
produced microglial EVs are able to influence multiple
biological pathways and promote activation of autop-
hagy in order to maintain microglia survival and
homoeostasis.

Introduction:
Extracellular
vesicles
(EVs)
have
emerged as key indicators and effectors of ageing.
Although plasma concentrations of EVs decline with
age, the EV biomarkers associated with ageing and
longevity are not fully understood. Recently, our
group found an age-related decline of plasma EVs
associated with immune cells during normal human
ageing. Our study aims to evaluate the association of
plasma EVs with longevity.
Methods: Plasma samples were selected from the
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of
the Elderly study subjects (n = 48): half dying within
2 years (short-lived group) and half surviving ≥10 years
(long-lived group) after the blood draw; all matched for
age (median age 77.3 ± 1.7 years, range 72–80), gender
(50% female), and race (50% White/50% Black). The
samples were acquired under donor consent and IRB
approval of Duke University. EVs were separated from
the plasma samples, and profiled based on the surface
markers
of
haematopoietic
stem
cells
(HSCs),
mesenchymal stem cells, immune cells, skeletal mus-
cles, cardiac muscles and adipocytes (CD81, CD9,
CD29, CD63, CD8, CD4, CD68, CD14, CD56, CD15,
CD19, CD235a, CD41a, CD34, CD31, HLA-ABC,
HLA-G, HLA-DRDPDQ, CD90, CD73, CD105, M
Cadherin, RYR1, RYR2, FABP4, DLK1). The percen-
tages of EVs expressing each tested molecule were
determined using a high-resolution multicolour BD
LSR Fortessa X-20 Flow Cytometer as we recently
reported. GraphPad Prism 8.0 software was used for
statistical analysis.
Results: We found significantly increased percentages
of CD9+, HLA-ABC+, CD31+ and CD41a+ large EVs
(1000–6000 nm) in the long-lived compared to the
short-lived group. None of the tested surface marker
expressing medium (100–1000 nm) or small (<100 nm)
EVs showed differential percentages between the short-
and long-lived groups.
Summary/Conclusion: EVs carry surface markers
from their parent cells. CD9 is expressed by HSCs
and immune cells. CD9 regulates homing of human
cord blood CD34+ HSCs, and delivers a potent CD28-
independent costimulatory signal to activate T cells.
HLA-ABC, the key human immunogen, is expressed

Introduction: It is anticipated that stem/progenitor
cells-derived
extracellular
vesicles
(SPC-EVs)
will
rapidly progress towards clinical studies, and the devel-
opment of reproducible, efficient, scalable and cost-
effective process for their production is expected to
boost the therapeutic applications of EVs-based pro-
ducts. In addition, the use of defined serum-/xeno-
geneic(xeno)-free culture medium formulations could
result in substantial improvements for SPC-EVs pro-
duction in terms of reproducibility, stability and qual-
ity, while ensuring the approval of regulatory agencies.
The main goal of this work is to develop a full-con-
trolled
manufacturing
platform
for
the
SPC-EVs
production.
Methods: Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC)
were expanded in a xeno-free microcarrier-based
bioreactor culture system operating in fed-batch
feeding mode and after 10 days the conditioned
medium was collected. Different methods for SPC-
EV isolation/purification from the MSC-derived con-
ditioned medium, including chromatography were
compared and the the quality of the final product
obtained was characterized by different methods
according to MISEV, including nanoparticle tracking
analysis, lipidomics and Western blot. Moreover
Fourier-Transform
InfraRed
(FTIR)
spectroscopy
was evaluated in terms of its implementation as a
standard technique for the identification and charac-
terization of EVs.
Results: After 10 days of MSC expansion under
dynamic conditions, we collected 1.3 L of conditioned
medium with approximately 0.5 million EVs/MSC. A
combination of a pretreatment with a nuclease for the
digestion of DNA/chromatin with a purification using
strong anion exchange chromatography led to the best
results so far in terms of EVs isolation. Of notice, by
FTIR spectroscopy, it was possible to define ratios of
spectral bands, that can be used as biomarkers,
enabling the discrimination of EVs chemical finger-
print in function of the culture conditions tested.
Summary/Conclusion:
The
platform
established
herein could be applied to the production of well-
characterized SPC-EVs targeting their biomedical use
in different settings (e.g. as drug delivery systems), as
well as EVs from other parental cells lines (i.e. dendri-
tic cells) in therapeutic settings as cancer.

Wyss Institute, Boston, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released
by all cells into biofluids and hold great promise as
reservoirs of disease biomarkers. One of the main
challenges in studying EVs and using them in diag-
nostics is a lack of suitable methods to quantify EVs
that are sensitive enough and can differentiate EVs
from similarly sized lipoproteins and protein aggre-
gates. We propose using ultrasensitive single molecule
array (Simoa) assays to quantify EVs by immuno-
isolating and detecting EV transmembrane proteins
in microwell arrays.

Methods: We developed single molecule array (Simoa)
assays using the Quanterix HD-X Analyser for the quan-
tification of EVs using the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and
CD81. Simoa allows for the detection of single proteins
using arrays of femtoliter wells, turning ELISA into a
digital immunoassay. We then used these assays,
together with an additional assay for albumin, to com-
pare commonly used EV isolation methods from plasma
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): ultracentrifugation, pre-
cipitation (ExoQuick), and size exclusion chromatogra-
phy (SEC) using the Izon qEV columns. We further
used these assays to rapidly optimize and improve SEC
by comparing different SEC resins and column dimen-
sions in both plasma and CSF.
Results: In comparing our Simoa assays to traditional
ELISA with the same antibodies, we found that the
Simoa assays were more than 100 times more sensitive,
detecting the tetraspanins in samples where the pro-
teins were undetectable by ELISA. Given the high
dynamic range and high-throughput capabilities of
Simoa, we were able to comprehensively compare rela-
tive EV yields and EV purity for different isolation
methods of EVs from plasma and CSF. We provide
average tetraspanin and albumin levels to directly com-
pare the methods. We also tested different SEC resins
and provide data for custom SEC columns that outper-
form Izon qEV and allow for fine tuning of different
ratios of EVs to albumin.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results highlight the utility
of quantifying EVs using ultrasensitive Simoa assays
for tetraspanins. We were able to rapidly Simoa to
rapidly evaluate different EV isolation methods in
CSF and plasma. In general, the experimental frame-
work we present could be easily applied to evaluate
new EV isolation methods, or applied to any other
biological fluid. Thus, we think Simoa is a powerful
new tool for relative EV quantitation.

Introduction: The protein profile of extracellular vesi-
cle (EV) subpopulations has been shown to contain
valuable
disease
information,
notably
in
cancer.
Currently, techniques aiming to find EV proteins that
associate together mainly focus on transmembrane
proteins, while methods that also probe cytosolic pro-
teins generally resort to a combination of affinity cap-
ture, elution, and lysis, which limits throughput. To
allow the high-throughput analysis of both membrane
and cytosolic EV proteins, we optimized a Total
Extracellular Vesicle Antibody Microarray (tEVAM)
incorporating fixation and heat-induced epitope retrie-
val (HIER), then leveraged it to perform combinatorial
protein profiling of EVs from colorectal cancer (CRC)
cell lines HT29 and SW403.
Methods: Arrays of IgGs targeting surface protein
markers were incubated overnight with EVs purified
from cancer cell line supernatants. HIER optimiza-
tion was carried out through variation of buffer con-
tents, presence or absence of prior permeabilization,
as well as incubation time and temperature, for a
total of 38 conditions. A431 EVs, previously profiled
with other methods, were used as a model during the
optimization. Cytosolic protein HSP90 and mem-
brane marker EGFR, both with high expression in
A431 EVs, were probed and the results used to com-
pare HIER conditions. Following HIER treatment,
protein targets were detected through incubation
with primary antibodies and fluorescent secondary
antibodies or streptavidin. The resulting optimized
tEVAM workflow was used to phenotype HT29 and
SW403 EVs through probing of trios of surface (2)
and internal (1) protein targets.
Results: The selected tEVAM protocol successfully
maximized HSP90 signal while minimally affecting
EGFR detection, enabling simultaneous analysis of sur-
face and internal proteins. Profiles of more than 450
combinations, featuring integrins, claudins, cytokines,
and other key actors of cancer-relevant pathways, were
obtained for HT29 and SW403 EVs, revealing co-
expression patterns that highlight the biomolecular
heterogeneity both within and between CRC cell
line EVs.
Summary/Conclusion:
Using
tEVAM,
intra-
and
extravesicular proteins can be detected simultaneously
in EVs immobilized based on surface protein content,
yielding extensive combinatorial protein profiles with
significance for health and biomarker research.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have the
potential to serve as valuable biomarkers for patient
response to cancer therapy. However, development of
robust EV-based clinical assays relies on knowledge of
EV concentration and diameter distribution. Many
different methods exist to measure the size and con-
centration of EVs, and each method exhibits strengths
and limitations. It is important to use orthogonal
methods for determination of these important proper-
ties of EV preparations. Here, we use dendritic cell-
derived EVs to demonstrate that some EV analysis
methods can give a biased interpretation of both dia-
meter and concentration. Through comparison, we
highlight why orthogonal assays are essential in provid-
ing measurement reliability.
Methods: DC2.4 mouse dendritic cells were cultured in
flasks containing a total of 1.2 L of EV-depleted media
(10% FBS, centrifuged 18 hr. x 100,000 g.) When cells
reached 80% confluency, conditioned media was col-
lected, depleted of debris with two 10 min. x 2,500 g
spins, and concentrated down to ~5 mL using a Pall
Jumbosep 100 kDa MWCO filter. The EV concentrate
was purified from protein using an Izon qEV-10 col-
umn, with 5 mL fractions collected. The protein con-
tent of the EV-containing fractions was analysed by
A280, Pierce BCA, and bioanalyzer. The diameter dis-
tribution of the EVs was determined by nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA), resistive pulse sensing (RPS),
flow cytometry (FCM), and electron microscopy (EM.)
Concentration was compared using NTA, RPS, and
FCM. EVs were further analysed by protein mass spec-
trometry and RNA sequencing.
Results: We have identified two distinct populations of
EVs with our DC2.4 preparation, one highly abundant
population with a power-law distribution, whose peak
diameter is below 60 nm, and a second, less abundant
population with a peak diameter at approximately
140 nm. These two distinct populations and their rela-
tive concentration were not detectable with all analysis
techniques. Based on cross-platform measurements,
these populations appear to have distinct compositions
that warrant further investigation.
Summary/Conclusion: The use of orthogonal methods
allowed the detection of two discrete populations of
EVs which was not possible on some platforms and
would have resulted in a biased perspective of the
sample composition. This work has highlighted the
need for orthogonal measurements to be conducted
by pairing techniques that do not have the same biases.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-
sized vesicles shed by all cells that serve vital roles in
cell-to-cell
communication.
Tumour-associated
EV
subpopulations vary in molecular content (lipids, pro-
teins, nucleic acids, small molecules), enabling mini-
mally invasive spectroscopic analysis for a wide variety
of cancers. Here, we use surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) in combination with a novel plas-
monic substrate for global chemical composition ana-
lysis of cancerous and non-cancerous populations of
EVs to determine distinguishing surface characteristics.
Methods: EVs were isolated from ovarian cancer
(OvCa) patient serum samples by differential ultracen-
trifugation. A new hybrid nanoplasmonic scaffold
comprised
of
a
microscale
biosilicate
diatoms
embedded with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was used
for SERS measurements. The substrate was incubated
with
cysteamine
to
positively-charge
the
AgNPs
(responsible for the SERS enhancement) so that EVs
could attach (EVs are naturally anionic). In a typical
experiment, 40 μL of ~108 particles/mL EVs per sam-
ple were incubated with the porous substrate surface,
which was inverted on a glass cover slip for Raman

interrogation. Principle component analysis (PCA) was
used to compare the spectra and determine distin-
guishing characteristics between populations from
tumour and non-tumour sources. We also trypsinized
EVs before SERS analysis to see the extent of influence
the surface molecules play in localizing the EVs to the
AgNP “hot spots.”
Results: A total of 8 clinical samples (7 OvCa and 1
non-malignant control) were tested in combination
with OvCa SKOV-3 cell line EVs. Simple PCA was
able to separate clinical samples according to disease
subtype and major peaks were identified to provide
chemical content analysis. Each sample exhibited
inherent heterogeneity but clustered together in a dis-
tinguishable way from the others.
Summary/Conclusion: Despite innate heterogeneity
within single samples (i.e., EVs isolated from a single
patient sample), EVs isolated from clinical samples
could be easily distinguished from each other using
our hybrid SERS substrate, with minimal sample pro-
cessing, a label-free approach, and only a few micro-
litres of sample. Our study using this novel plasmonic
material demonstrates its potential for use as a compo-
nent in next-generation diagnostic platforms.

aUniversity of California, Davis, Fremont, USA; bDepartment of Biomedical
Engineering, University of California, Davis, Davis, USA
Introduction: Single-particle analysis is critical for
understanding extracellular vesicle (EV) heterogeneity.
Yet such techniques remain technically challenging due
to low detection sensitivity and presence of variable
amounts of “contaminants,” including lipoproteins.
The high degree of structural similarity between EVs
and lipoproteins in size, density, and chemical compo-
sition, results in their co-isolation using any of the
standard EV isolation techniques. Here we introduce
Laser Trapping Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) as a well-
suited, label-free, and non-destructive tool to distin-
guish EVs from various lipoprotein species at single
particle resolution.
Methods: EV samples were isolated from SKOV-3 cell
culture supernatant by differential ultracentrifugation
and their Raman spectra measured. As the most abun-
dant lipoproteins in EV isolations from human bio-
fluids are sub-micron low density lipoprotein (LDL),
very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and high density
lipoprotein (HDL) particles, these were purchased as
pure components and also measured by LTRS. LDL
and VLDL were then spiked-in to isolated EVs to
mimic
“contaminated”
post-isolation
EV
samples.
Raman spectra were analysed by principal component
analysis (PCA) using a custom MATLAB script.
Results: LDL and VLDL have been observed to adhere
to EV surfaces in vitro after standard isolation techni-
ques. We could readily distinguish pure VLDL, LDL,
and HDL standards according to their Raman spectra.
PCA revealed distinction of SKOV-3 EVs from both
LDL and VLDL. PCA also differentiated SKOV-3 EVs
incubated with LDL from SKOV-3 EVs incubated with
VLDL. Extent of LDL and VLDL adherence to EVs
could be observed and quantified.
Summary/Conclusion: Through Raman and PCA,
classes of lipoprotein and EVs can be identified and
quantified when co-incubated. LTRS is a quantitative
single-EV analysis technique that can be used to
differentiate between lipoprotein classes and EVs
when incubated together. This technique allows for
analysis of EVs where standard isolation methods fall
short.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogen-
ous membrane-derived vesicles that shuttle lipids, pro-
teins or nucleic acids between glia and neurons,
thereby promoting neuronal survival and plasticity in
the CNS and contributing to neurodegenerative condi-
tions. Although EVs hold great potential as CNS ther-
anostic nanocarriers, the specific molecular factors that
regulate neuronal EV uptake and release are currently
unknown.
Methods: We used a combination of patch-clamp elec-
trophysiology and pH-sensitive dye imaging to exam-
ine stimulus-evoked EV release in individual neurons
in real time.
Results: Whereas spontaneous electrical activity and the
application of a high-frequency stimulus (HFS) induced
a slow and prolonged fusion of multivesicular bodies
(MVBs) with the plasma membrane (PM) in a subset of
cells, the neurotrophic factor bFGF (basic fibroblast
growth factor) greatly increased the rate of stimulus-
evoked MVB-PM fusion events and, consequently, the
abundance of EVs in the culture medium. Proteomic
analysis of neuronal EVs demonstrated bFGF to
increase the abundance of the v-SNARE vesicle-asso-
ciated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3, cellubrevin) on
EVs. Conversely, knocking-down VAMP3 in cultured
neurons attenuated the effect of bFGF on EV release.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results determine for the
first time the temporal characteristics of MVB-PM
fusion in hippocampal neurons and reveal a new
function for bFGF signalling in controlling neuronal
EV release.

Introduction: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) function as
chaperones under both normal and pathologic conditions.
As chaperones they assist in protein folding, in holding
protein complexes for current or future activation, and in
degradation of senescent proteins for recycling of compo-
nents and display for immune surveillance. During stress-
ful situations, HSP quantities and/or activities increase as
cells and tissues seek protection from insults. These insults
can result in the cell surface display of HSPs, which can
then lead to the surface display of HSPs on extracellular
vesicles (EVs). HSPs present on the cell surface or in the
extracellular space are regarded as “danger signals” in an
ancient biologic paradigm. HSP-accessorized EVs may act
as “danger boli”, carrying not only the HSPs, but hundreds
of components of the stressed parental cell, capable of
prompting differential responses depending on the status
of the recipient cell.
Methods: Clarified/filtered plasma from patients suf-
fering from neurologic maladies (cancer, brain injury,
multiple
sclerosis)
was

peptides
designed to bind HSPs. The EVs congeal under these

and subjected them to metabolomic analyses (focused
on lipids) or assayed them on phosphokinase arrays.
Results: We show that EVs from the blood of patients
suffering from brain tumours, or from TBI, or from MS,
possess distinct metabolomes compared to blood EVs
from healthy donors. We found hundreds of differen-
tially-expressed lipids amongst the patients vs the healthy
donors. The levels of annotation and identification for
these compounds ranges from level 4 (low, no matches in
databases) to level 2 (high, annotation matches to known
database components). In addition, we found differences
in phosphorylated kinases as cargo in these EVs between
patients with matched primary vs recurrent gliomas, and
among TBI/stroke patients compared to healthy donors.
Summary/Conclusion: HSP-accessorized EVs present
different metabolomic and phosphokinase content
which may serve as biomarkers in a “liquid biopsy”
setting, but may also play roles in the pathobiology of
neurologic diseases.

Introduction: Methamphetamine (MA) has deleterious
effects to both peripheral organs and the central nervous
system. The rewarding properties and addictive poten-
tial of MA are correlated with increased synaptic dopa-
mine availability following alterations in dopamine and
vesicular monoamine transporter function. In rodents,
MA alters brain miRNA expression and the miRNA
content of serum extracellular vesicles (EV). Here we
examined plasma EVs isolated from human subjects
actively using MA (MA-ACT) for size, concentration,
protein markers, and miRNA content.
Methods: Plasma samples from 10 MA-ACT, and 10 con-
trols (CTL) were obtained from the Methamphetamine
Abuse Research Center. Plasma EVs were evaluated by
vesicle flow cytometry (VFC) for size, concentration, and
surface protein markers. VFC antibodies included markers
for a pool of tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81), platelet
EVs (CD41), pro-coagulant EVs (AnnV), and red blood
cell EVs (CD235). Next plasma EV isolated by size exclu-
sion chromatography were analysed by qPCR on TaqMan®
Array Human MicroRNA A + B Card Set v3.0. Fold
change was calculated by ΔΔCq between MA-ACT and
CTL for miRNA expressed in ≥60% of samples in at least 1
group. We identified the top 20% of ranked miRNA by F-
statistic; of these, the miRNA of interest for MA-ACT were
identified by at least a (i) 1.2 fold change in expression, (ii)
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
0.75, and (iii) Glass’s Δ of 1. For miRNA of interest
correlations to additional MA variables were conducted,
along with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of predicted gene
targets. Tobacco use was controlled for.
Results: VFC data show that the size (~110 nm) and
concentration (~7.5 x 1010 particles/ml) of all plasma
EVs is comparable between MA-ACT and CTL groups.
In addition, the plasma EVs primarily consist of tetraspa-
nin+, AnnV+, or CD41+ EVs, and to a much lesser extent
CD235+ EVs. Of the 207 miRNA expressed in MA-ACT
and/or CTL plasma EVs, there were 110 miRNA that have
at least a 1.2 fold increase or decrease in MA-ACT. 10
miRNA were identified to be of interest in MA-ACT based
on fold change, effect size and diagnostic potential, com-
pared to CTL. Further, 5 of the 10 miRNA correlate with a
MA associated variable, including frequency of use and age
of first use. Together the 10 miRNA best cluster subjects
based on MA-ACT status, not tobacco use. Finally, the
predicted gene targets of the 10 miRNA are associated with
canonical pathways linked to MA.
Summary/Conclusion: EV miRNA expression in MA-
ACT subjects was unique to CTL participants, suggest-
ing that MA may affect EV communication among
cells. The differential miRNA expression also impli-
cates a role for EVs in behavioural and physiological
effects specific to MA, and suggests that there may be
changes in expression of miRNA that are relevant to
specific drugs of addiction, as well as to a spectrum of
drug-mediated addiction disorders.

is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that bone marrow-
derived EVs (BM-EVs) can modulate the ageing HSC
phenotype.
Methods: We flushed bone marrow from old (24–26-
month old) and young (6-8-week old) C57/BL6 mice
and collected BM-EVs by differential centrifugation
(2000 × g for 30 min, supernatant collected and cen-
trifuged 100,000 × g for 1 hour, BM-EV pellet collected
and quantified by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis). We
injected old mice with 2 x 10^9 young BM-EVs via tail
vein, daily x 3 days. Control mice were injected with
age-matched BM-EVs or vehicle alone. We euthanized
the mice one month post-injection, harvested whole
bone marrow (WBM) and highly purified HSCs
(Lineage negative/c-Kit+/Sca-1+/CD150+; LSK-SLAM)
and tested stem cell function in competitive bone mar-
row transplants (4–5 recipients/group).
Results: At 6 months post-transplant, WBM from old
mice exposed to young BM-EVs exhibited a statistically
significant decrease in engraftment when compared to
WBM exposed to age-matched BM-EVs (percent aver-
age donor chimerism ± SEM: 15% ± 5% (young EVs)
vs. 61% ± 14% (old EVs)). For LSK-SLAM from old
mice, we observed a trend towards decreased engraft-
ment when exposed to young BM-EVs and a trend
towards increased engraftment potential when exposed
to old BM-EVs (percent average donor chimerism ±
SEM: 7% ± 4% (young EVs), 27% ± 10% (old EVs),
15% ± 2% (vehicle)). These findings are consistent with
our previous data showing that, in contrast to highly
purified HSCs which develop impaired stem cell func-
tion with ageing, total un-separated old WBM actually
has increased engraftment capacity when compared to
young WBM. Of note, we found that the classic mye-
loid skewing by old LSK-SLAM was partially reversed
by exposure to both young and old BM-EVs. Finally,
consistent with the known increase in highly purified
HSCs with age, our preliminary data showed that old
mice exposed to young BM-EVs had an approximately
7-fold decrease in the number of LSK-SLAM cells in
marrow, indicating that BM-EVs may influence age-
related changes in HSC number.
Summary/Conclusion: These preliminary data sug-
gest BM-EVs may play a role in modulating HSC
ageing phenotypes, potentially altering engraftment
capacity, lineage fate, and LSK-SLAM population
size.
Future

the
molecular
mechanisms underlying these EV-mediated effects

Introduction: Brain extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
heterogenous and include previously described micro-
vesicles and exosomes. Herein we characterized a for-
merly
unappreciated
population
of
mitochondria-
derived
EVs
that
we
term
“mitovesicles”.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-established hall-
mark of ageing and neurodegenerative disorders as
Down syndrome (DS). Hence, we examined mitovesi-
cle levels and cargo under these conditions to charac-
terize in vivo mitovesicle biology and responsiveness to
mitochondrial stressors.
Methods: Employing a high-resolution density gradi-
ent, distinct and novel populations of EVs were isolated
from murine and human DS and diploid control post-
mortem brains or from cell media. Morphometric EV
features were analysed by nanoparticle tracking analy-
sis and cryogenic electron microscopy, while EV con-
stituents were characterized by Western blotting, mass
spectrometry, lipid profiling and mitochondrial RNA
qPCR.
Results: We identified a population of double-mem-
brane, electron-dense brain EVs containing multiple
mitochondrial markers (“mitovesicles”) that are highly
distinct from microvesicles and exosomes. Proteomic
data show that mitovesicles contain a unique subset of
mitochondrial proteins while lacking others, such as
Tom20. Mitovesicles have a lipid composition that is
unlike that of previously described EVs and is consis-
tent with mitochondrial origin. Functionally, the com-
plex-III inhibitor antimycin-A stimulated in vitro
mitovesicle release into the cell media, suggesting an
interrelationship between mitochondrial dysfunction
and mitovesicle biology. In mouse brains, mitovesicle
levels increased with age and were found to be higher
in DS compared to diploid controls. Mitochondrial
RNA and protein levels were also altered in DS com-
pared to diploid controls.
Summary/Conclusion: We describe a previously uni-
dentified type of metabolically competent EVs of mito-
chondrial origin that we designate mitovesicles. Our
data demonstrate that brain mitovesicle levels and
cargo are tightly regulated in normal conditions and
are modified during pathophysiological processes in
which mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, suggesting
that mitovesicles are a previously unrecognized player
in mitochondria quality control and may have a role in
the trans-cellular tissue response to oxidative stress.

into extracellular vesicles (EVs) and releasing them to
infect other cells. One enzyme involved in the biogen-
esis of EVs is neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2),
which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to
produce
phosphorylcholine
and
ceramide.
Several
groups have reported improved cognition and reduced
tau propagation when nSMase2 is pharmacologically
inhibited or genetically knocked down in AD mouse
models. Unfortunately, current nSMase2 inhibitors are
not suitable for clinical development due to poor solu-
bility and inadequate pharmacokinetic profiles.
Methods: Our group carried out a high-throughput
screening campaign followed by extensive medicinal
chemistry efforts leading to the discovery of phenyl

[1,2-b]
pyridazin-8-yl)
pyrrolidin-3-yl)
carbamate
(PDDC), an orally active, nM potent inhibitor with
excellent selectivity and brain penetration. We tested
PDDC’s ability to inhibit exosome release in cultured
primary glial cells as well as an in vivo model of acute
EV release. We then treated 5XFAD mice with 10 mg/
kg of PDDC daily for six months and monitored their
behaviour in the fear conditioning assay.
Results: PDDC dose dependently reduced EV release
from cultured primary glial cells and significantly
reduced plasma EV numbers in an in vivo model.
Following chronic treatment with PDDC, 5XFAD
mice demonstrated significantly improved cognitive
function in the fear conditioning assay.
Summary/Conclusion: These promising findings are
currently being expanded using mouse models of tau
propagation. If successful, these data would support
PDDC as a novel compound for targeting the patholo-
gical spread of tau as a therapeutic for AD.

Introduction: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is
one of the leading causes of disability worldwide,
affecting 20% of the population. The environment
has been thought to play a role in the disease devel-
opment, resulting in biological changes mediated by
epigenetic mechanisms. MicroRNA’s (miRNA) are
well known epigenetic regulators that are disrupted
in the depressed brain, and they are packaged into
extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs have emerged as
means of intercellular communication, a process that
is also disrupted in MDD. They are thought to trans-
fer miRNA between cells, which can alter gene expres-
sion in recipient cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that
EV cargo is altered in MDD subjects compared to
healthy controls (HC). The aim is to extract EVs
from human post-mortem anterior cingulate cortex,
a region previously associated with depression, and
profile the miRNA cargo and compare it between
MDD subjects and HC.
Methods: Post-mortem human brain tissue from the
anterior cingulate cortex of 20 MDD subjects and 20
HC was mildly dissociated in the presence of collage-
nase type III. Residual tissue, cells, and large vesicles
were eliminated, and EVs were isolated using size
exclusion chromatography. The quality was assessed
by western blots and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). RNA was extracted and a small-RNA library
was constructed and sequenced using the Illumina
Platform. Differential expression analysis was then
performed.
Results: Western blots showed little to no Endoplasmic
Reticulum (Calnexin), Golgi (BiP), or mitochondrial
(VDAC) contamination, along with enrichment of the
exosomal marker CD9. TEM images showed the typical
cup-shaped morphology with sizes mostly between 30

that miR-33a-5p, which is predicted to target glutamate

Summary/Conclusion: High quality EV extractions
can be obtained from post-mortem brain tissue using
our method. This will be the first study to profile brain-
derived EV miRNA in the context of depression.
Future studies will be needed to determine the effect
of the different levels of miR-33a-5p. This could pro-
vide novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiol-
ogy of MDD and will serve as a starting point to
examine the potential role of EVs in MDD pathology.

Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is charac-
terized by diverse primary mechanisms of injury that
lead to the development of secondary pathological cas-
cades that drive neurological deficit post-TBI. Inability
to separate patients based on the presence of these
different endophenotypes represents a major challenge
for diagnosis and treatment of TBI.
Extracellular vesicles including exosomes isolated
from patient plasma have emerged as promising poten-
tial biomarkers for TBI due to their ability to cross the
BBB into systemic circulation with molecular cargo
intact for analysis. We have developed a novel micro-
fluidic platform for rapid isolation of brain-derived
EVs providing a tool with which the biochemical
state of neurons and glia can be directly assessed
post-TBI. We used the ultra-sensitive, single molecule
array (SIMOA) to quantify concentrations of 7 protein
biomarkers from the plasma and brain derived EVs
from mild TBI patients and controls. By combining
multiple protein biomarkers, we could discriminate
mTBI patients from controls in both the training and
the blinded test set.
Building on this work, we are also characterizing
single EV heterogeneity of neuron derived EVs by
developing novel droplet based digital assay for single
EV quantification at ultra-low concentration. Droplet
based assay for single EV analysis would potentially be
very informative for early disease diagnosis and therapy
decision.
Methods: Our microfluidic platform for EV isolation
consists of tracked-etched membranes with millions of
nanopores (600 nm), coated with a magnetic film
(NiFe)
to
precisely
capture
immunomagnetically
labelled brain-specific EVs from plasma. Single mole-
cule array (SIMOA) was used to quantify concentra-
tions of the 7 protein biomarkers (Tau, UCHL-1, NFL,
GFAP, IL6, IL10, and TNF) in the plasma and brain-
derived exosomes of mild TBI (mTBI) patients and
controls. To identify single EV, we applied droplet
based
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
and
encoded the fluorescent signal for single EV quantifi-
cation within parallelized microfluidic platform.
Results: We report that concentrations of plasma and
exosome GFAP, NFL, and UCHL1 were elevated in
mTBI patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and
that each of these biomarkers are uncorrelated with
one another. Discrimination of mTBI patients from
controls was most accurate when machine learning
algorithms on the panel of biomarkers. Specifically,
combining plasma NFL, GFAP, IL6 and TNF- with
Tau from GluR2+ EVs showed 88% accuracy with
80% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
Summary/Conclusion: This data suggests that neuron-
derived exosomes contain information that charac-
terizes the injured and recovering brain. It also suggests
that analysis of a panel of biomarkers from a combina-
tion of both blood and exosomal compartments could
lead to more accurate diagnosis of mTBIs.

L1CAM is not associated with extracellular vesicles in cerebrospinal fluid
or plasma
Maia Norman, Dmitry Ter-Ovanesyan, Wendy Trieu and David Walt
Wyss Institute, Boston, USA
Introduction: Neurons in living psychiatric and neu-
rological patients are inaccessible for cell type specific
analysis of RNA and protein. Our understanding of
these diseases instead relies upon imperfect sources of
biochemical information such as post-mortem brain
tissue analysis and animal models. Furthermore, there
is a paucity of biochemical assays available to diagnose
and manage brain diseases. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
present an opportunity to noninvasively sample the
contents of neurons in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
plasma.
In
order
to
isolate
neuron-derived
EVs
(NDEVs), a cell type specific transmembrane protein
is necessary for immunocapture. L1CAM, a protein
abundant on the surface of neurons, has been used
extensively in the literature for NDEV isolation.
However, L1CAM exists in humans in several isoforms
without a transmembrane domain, and as such it can
be secreted as a free protein. Additionally, the ectodo-
main of L1CAM can be cleaved off of the cell surface in
physiological processes. It remains to be demonstrated
whether the L1CAM found in CSF and plasma is EV
associated, or if it is instead a spliced or cleaved iso-
form behaving as a free protein.
Methods: Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), a
digital form of ELISA, as well as Western blotting, we
quantify EV markers (CD9, CD63 and CD81) as well as
L1CAM and Albumin. We use these assays to deter-
mine in which fractions of size exclusion chromatogra-
phy (SEC) and density gradient the L1CAM appears.
We also immunocapture L1CAM from CSF and

plasma and perform Western blots for the internal and
external domains of L1CAM.
Results: Simoa and Western blot analysis of SEC and
density gradient fractions demonstrated that while the
EV markers peaked all together, L1CAM eluted in the
free protein fractions along with Albumin in both CSF
and plasma. When immunoprecipitation was per-
formed, Western blotting revealed different isoforms
of L1CAM in CSF and plasma.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data utilize a multitude of
distinct techniques that converge to demonstrate that
L1CAM is not associated with EVs in CSF or plasma.
Furthermore, our data suggest that the isoforms pre-
sent in CSF and plasma are distinct, which indicates
that the L1CAM in plasma is likely not coming from
the brain. This data call into question the utility of
L1CAM as a NDEV marker and point to the need to
find novel candidates for immunoprecipitation of
NDEVs.

Introduction: In Parkinson’s disease (PD), α-synuclein
(α-Syn) aggregates known as Lewy bodies (LB) are
present in both the central and peripheral nervous
system. Furthermore, data showing that α-Syn can
spread from PD patients to transplanted tissue has led
to a new theory postulating that pathological forms of
α-Syn can drive disease by “infecting” healthy cells and
corrupting normal proteins. The exact routes and
mechanisms involved in such spreading are yet to be
fully understood but it is known that α-Syn can be
secreted from cells and transported via extracellular
vesicles (EV). EV derived from erythrocytes (EEV)
are of particular interest in this regard as they have
been shown to contain α-Syn.
Methods: We first optimized a protocol for the isola-
tion of fluorescently labelled human EEV. The capacity
of these EEV to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
was then evaluated in vitro using a Boyden chamber
composed of primary human brain endothelial cells.
Next, EEV were added to a more complex and physio-
logically relevant 3D human BBB model including
iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. In
both in vitro protocols, flow cytometry was performed
on media collect from each compartment to determine
the number of EEV. Immunofluorescence was per-
formed to assess the localization of fluorophore tagged
EEV. We are also using an in vivo paradigm for the
extraction and testing of EEV spread and an in situ
cerebral perfusion (ISBP) model in WT mice to inves-
tigate if and how EEV cross the BBB using confocal
microscopy.
Results: In both in vitro models, flow cytometry ana-
lyses showed that fluorescently tagged EEV added to
the luminal side traversed the endothelial cell barrier.
Confocal analysis revealed that some EEV could also be
found within endothelial cells themselves. Ongoing
experiments are being conducted in our newly devel-
oped 3D BBB to further confirm these results. Our
preliminary in vivo experiments showed that fluores-
cently labelled beads, similar in size to EEV, used in the
ISBP experiments are detectable in the brain parench-
yma of injected WT mice using confocal microscopy.
Preliminary work also includes ISBP injections of EEV
in 6-month-old WT mice, (n = 6/groups) derived from
PD patients (at different stage of the disease) and a
healthy individual as a control.
Summary/Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggests
that EEV can indeed move across the BBB in both in
vitro and in vivo experimental setups. Ongoing experi-
ments will determine the dynamics and processes
involved in this transport and whether EEV can pre-
cipitate and/or exacerbate disease-related features.

Introduction: Neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of
childhood cancer mortality. Amplification of the onco-
gene N-Myc is a well-established poor prognostic mar-
ker for neuroblastoma. Whilst N-Myc amplification
status strongly correlates with higher tumour aggres-
sion and resistance to treatment, the role of N-Myc in
the aggressiveness of the disease is poorly understood.
Exosomes are released by many cell types including
cancer cells and are implicated as key mediators in
cell-cell communication via the transfer of molecular
cargo. Hence, characterising the exosomal protein
components from N-Myc amplified and non-amplified
neuroblastoma cells will improve our understanding on
their role in the progression of neuroblastoma.
Methods: In this study, comparative proteomic analy-
sis, nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission elec-
tron microscopy, RNAi-based knockdown, migration
and cellular survivability assays were performed to
understand the role of exosomes isolated from cells
with varying N-Myc amplification status.
Results: Label-free quantitative proteomic profiling
revealed 968 proteins that are differentially abundant
in exosomes released by the N-Myc amplified and non-
amplified neuroblastoma cells. Gene ontology-based
analysis
highlighted
the
enrichment
of
proteins
involved in cell communication and signal transduc-
tion in N-Myc amplified exosomes. Treatment of less
aggressive SH-SY5Y cells with N-Myc amplified SK-N-
BE2 cell-derived exosomes increased the migratory
potential, colony forming abilities and conferred resis-
tance to doxorubicin induced apoptosis. Incubation of
exosomes from N-Myc knocked down SK-N-BE2 cells
abolished the transfer of resistance to doxorubicin
induced apoptosis.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings suggest that
exosomes could play a pivotal role in N-Myc-driven
aggressive neuroblastoma and transfer of chemoresis-
tance between cells.

Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, USA
Introduction: Quantification and characterization of
single extracellular vesicles (sEVs) based on surface
markers can aid in dissecting the heterogeneous
landscape of EV subpopulations. We and others have
demonstrated the potential of imaging flow cytometry
(IFC) to perform sEV characterization. We recently
showed release of protoporphyrin (PpIX) positive
sEVs by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) dosed glioma
cells, in vitro and in vivo. Rickfels et al. also used IFC
to demonstrate the enrichment of CD63+/CD81+ EVs
in the plasma of glioma patients. Herein, we performed
in vitro studies to characterize EV subfractions using 5-
ALA as well as EV and CNS specific surface markers.
Methods: We use IFC to characterize EVs released by
glioma using 5-ALA, fluorescently labelled EV (CFDA-
SE, CD81) and glioma specific (tenascin C and epider-
mal growth factor receptor vIII, EGFRvIII) markers.
Furthermore,
we
characterized
EVs
released
by
EGFRvIII positive glioma cells treated with dexametha-
sone, a steroid commonly used in glioma patients, to
determine the effect of steroids on EV release. EVs
were quantified by IFC and results were confirmed by
qPCR for the levels of EGFRvIII mRNA.
Results: Firstly, we optimized protocols to label glioma
sEVs using fluorescently labelled EV markers (CFDA-
SE, CD81) and tumour specific markers (tenascin C
and EGFRvIII). Of the total EVs (CFDA-SE), we
demonstrate that 58% are tenascin C positive, 2.7%
are EGFRvIII positive and 1.6% are 5-ALA positive.
There was only a minor overlap (<16%) between the
sub-populations. Finally, we show that dexamethasone
treated glioma cells release lower total EVs (2.5-fold),
tumour specific EVs (2.8-fold; EGFRvIII), EGFRvIII
mRNA compared to mock treated cells.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential
of IFC to monitor sEVs released by glioma cells
exposed to different stimuli. This allows the character-
ization of EV sub-populations providing a working
model to understand the dynamics of tumour EVs at
a single vesicle level.

cereals and cotton, respectively. Fgr and Fov cause
economic losses and threaten food and fibre supplies
worldwide. Understanding host-pathogen interactions
is crucial for developing new strategies for disease
control. We are determining whether extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) have a role in the interaction between fungal
pathogens and their host plant.
Methods: We isolated EVs from Fgr and Fov by size-
exclusion chromatography and characterized them by
NTA and TEM. EVs from Fgr and Fov are between
100–300 nm and have morphology similar to EVs
reported for other fungi. We performed label-free quan-
titative proteomics to describe the protein cargo of EVs
from Fgr and Fov, including a comparative study of EVs
from Fov grown on different media: Czapek Dox (CD)
and Saboraud’s Dextrose Broth (SDB).
Results: A total of 658 proteins were detected in Fgr
EVs and, according to prediction software EffectorP,
12.5% of these were potential effectors. Similarly, 70%
of EV proteins do not contain signal peptide indicating
that packaging into EVs is a novel mechanism of secre-
tion for these proteins. Notable Fgr EV proteins
include lipases, proteases and synthases for toxins and
chitin. Fov produced EVs in similar quantities in both
growth media tested, but EV protein cargo differed
between them. There was a 39% overlap in proteins
identified in the 465 CD and the 658 SBD EV proteins.
In general, EV proteins were involved in metabolism,
cell wall architecture and oxidoreduction, with 15.4%
and
12.9%
of
potential
effectors,
respectively.
Polyketide and toxin synthases, proteases and effectors
were present in both types of Fov EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: This new fungal EV isolation
method was rapid, yielded high-quality EVs, and did
not submit particles to high centrifugal forces. Our
data revealed that both Fgr and Fov produce EVs
enriched with proteins that could alter host immune
responses or facilitate fungal infection. Furthermore,
the protein composition of Fov EVs was dependant
on culture conditions. This supports a potential role
for fungal EVs in disease progression in plants and
provides the foundations to pursue the role of EVs in
plant-fungal interactions with the potential to identify
new targets for disease control.

Introduction: Extracellular Vesicles (EV) released by
infective forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of
Chagas’ disease, modulate inflammatory response of
macrophages through the activation of Toll 2 receptor
(TLR2) via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
This induces the production of nitric oxide (NO) and
expression of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-6,
which could explain the inflammation observed in
experimental Chagas’ disease, and eventually in the pro-
gression of human disease. EVs released by the parasite
are heterogeneous and it is unknown which factor, or
factors present in the different vesicle populations act
during the interaction with host cells. Objectives. The
goal of the present work was to characterize and isolate
the different populations of EVs released by T. cruzi and
test their effects on macrophages.
Methods: EV released by trypomastigotes forms of T.
cruzi (Y strain) were purified by Asymmetric flow field-
flow
fractionation
(AF4)
and
characterized
by
Nanoparticles tracking analysis (NTA). The different
populations of EVs were incubated with host human
monocytes cells (THP-1) and cytokines production deter-
mined by ELISA and qPCR. The different EV populations
were also incubated with LLCMK-2 epithelial cells and
the infection by T. cruzi determined.
Results: We found two distinct populations of EVs. A
population with 50 to 50 nm (EV1) and another with
100 to 120 nm (EV2). EV1 induced more TNF-alpha,
IL-6, IP-10 and CCL20 than EV2. It was also more
effective in promoting T. cruzi infection in epithelial
cells.
Summary/Conclusion: T. cruzi released two EV popu-
lations that affects differently host cells. Identification
of these EVs composition might help to better under-
stand the role of EVs in the modulation of T. cruzi
infection

with inducing morbidity and mortality by diarrhoea,
have a massive economic impact resulting in approxi-
mately 60 USD billion each year in healthcare costs and
missed worker productivity. Development of anti-viral
therapies for HuNoV has been hampered by the lack of
robust in vitro cultivation systems. Several cell types
support viral replication but only produce modest
amounts of virus due to unknown reasons, making
these systems insufficient for use in drug development
and infectivity assays.
Noroviruses are known to attach to gram-negative
enteric bacteria and this facilitates infection in vitro.
However, the microbiome- norovirus-host communi-
cation link is missing. Noroviruses infect immune cells
present in lamina propria during acute infection, but
bacteria themselves are large enough to cross the
mucosal and the tight epithelial barrier which separates
gut lumen from lamina propria. We hypothesized that
binding of noroviruses to bacteria enhances extracellu-
lar vesicles (EV) production. Because commensal bac-
terial EVs by themselves do not have any detrimental
effects on host cells, we believe using EVs in in vitro
culture will enhance norovirus infection, thus produ-
cing higher titre of viruses for vaccine and anti-viral
drug development.
Methods: Attachment assay: Purified norovirus was
incubated with Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus
acidophilus and Bacteroides thethiotaomicron, and
grown to produce EVs. The attachment was confirmed
via qPCR.
Isolation of EVs: Clarified media supernatants were
subjected to ultracentrifugation at varying speeds and
0.2um filtration. Co-purification of norovirus with the
EVs was checked.
EV quantification and characterization: EV total
protein content was measured by microBCA. The
number of vesicles were quantified by Nanoparticle
tracking analysis. Scanning and Transmission electron
microscopy was performed to check quality of EV
preparation and determine if virus was attached to
the vesicles. Internal EV protein content was evaluated
using MS-HPLC. The EVs were also check for infectiv-
ity via TCID50 assay.
Results: Incubation of noroviruses with commensal
bacteria resulted in significant increases in production
of EVs compared to uninfected controls. Murine nor-
ovirus (MNV), used as a surrogate, was found to be
associated with EVs. EM analysis determine associa-
tion of viruses with the bacteria as well as the MVs,
while also showing certain surface structural changes
in virus attached bacteria compared to mock bacteria.
The EVs were found to cause infection in naive
macrophages.
Summary/Conclusion: Changes in EV production and
content by bacteria exposed to noroviruses will provide
insight into its pathogenesis and possible solutions to
the low viral output from HuNoV culture systems.

Detection of bacterial extracellular vesicles in blood from healthy
volunteers

bChildrens National
Hospital, Washington, USA
Introduction: Bacteria constitutively produce biologi-
cally active extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain
RNA, DNA, and/or proteins. Bacteria use these EVs for
communication with other bacteria and recent research
suggests bacterial EVs can also affect host cells. Given
these findings, it is necessary to examine the role of
bacterial EVs in human disease. Current methods of
bacterial EV isolation from human specimens cannot
distinguish between bacterial species. However, there is
utility in examining EVs from specific species, as bacter-
ial species and their EVs may have unique contributions
to human disease. Our objective was to isolate circulat-
ing EVs specifically from Escherichia coli (EEVs) and
Haemophilus influenzae (HEVs), two known colonizers
and pathogens in the gut and airway, respectively.
Methods: Total EVs were isolated from the blood of six
healthy volunteers via precipitation and size exclusion
chromatography. EVs were then selected via a novel
latex bead-based fluorescent antibody construct target-
ing species-specific outer membrane proteins. We used
flow cytometry to evaluate the isolated EVs.
Results: The constructs were saturated with EEVs at an
antibody concentration of 11.5 µg/mL of plasma, as
geometric means ≥11.5 µg/mL were nearly equal.
HEVs were detected at 48 µg/mL of plasma, but satura-
tion is yet to be determined. EEVs were imaged by a
FEI Talos F200X electron microscope and measured
between 40–90 nm, and HEVs were between 60–
160 nm. Both types of EVs were spherical.
Summary/Conclusion: Using this novel technique, we
were able to isolate, detect, and visualize EEVs and
HEVs. This technique enables the study of specific
bacterial EVs. In the future, EV contents will be
assayed. Furthermore, this technique will be modified
so that specific bacterial EVs from body fluids can be
used for downstream functional applications. This is
the first time that bacterial EVs from targeted bacterial
species have been detected in blood from healthy
humans.

Introduction: New Zealand (NZ) has a population of
just 4.8 Million people with a remote geographical
location in the Pacific Ocean. Its unique culture,
food-based industries and ethnic population make NZ
an invaluable place for extracellular vesicle research
into all areas. However, as for many places in the
world, standardization of methodologies, training and
access to appropriate equipment is challenging.
Methods:
The
Hub
for
Extracellular
Vesicle
Investigations (HEVI) is a virtual research centre estab-
lished in 2017 with three-year seed funding from a
University of Auckland Strategic Research Initiatives
Fund. Two staff members are employed to support
training, education and optimization of methods. The
HEVI is guided by a governance group providing valu-
able input from Australasian experts in EVs.
Results: Since 2017 the HEVI has organized 2 research
symposia, 2 hands-on training days, hosted 2 interna-
tional students as well as providing one-on-one train-
ing for 41 individuals from universities and institutes
across NZ. Training is provided on multiple isolation
and characterization methods and tailored to indivi-
duals access to essential equipment without bias
towards
individual
manufacturers
or
techniques.
Travel funding has supported 38 people to attend con-
ferences and workshops for the purposes of education,
networking and research dissemination. The HEVI also
provides support for project design with 10 grants
awarded to HEVI members and a number of manu-
scripts in submission for publication.

Introduction: On 25 October 2019, we organized the
1st Lugano ExoDay, first initiative in the Southern
Switzerland to bring together resident researchers and
European experts in the field of Extracellular Vesicles
(EVs). The workshop, centred on “Technical challenges
of extracellular vesicle research” aimed to highlight
technical requirements and advances in the EVs area,
focusing on isolation, characterization and tracking.
Methods: The workshop started with a lecture by Dr.
Cecilia Lässer, from the University of Gothenburg. The
rest of the workshop was divided in two working
groups (WG), each introduced by a keynote lecture
followed by presentations by young researchers and a
round-table
discussion.
WG1,
introduced
by
Dr.
Mercedes Tkach, from the Institute Curie in Paris,
focused on recent advances on EVs characterization
and isolation. WG2 was centred on EVs tracking and
introduced by Dr. Frédérik Verweij, from the Institute
of Psychiatry and Neuroscience of Paris.
Results: Dr. Lässer opened the workshop with a com-
prehensive review and introduced recent developments
in the EVs field. The first WG discussed different
isolation methods, focusing on ultracentrifugation,
size exclusion chromatography and immunoprecipita-
tion-based
techniques.
Supported
by
the
keynote
speakers, the participants agreed that the best approach
to optimize the isolation process consists in the com-
bination of different techniques. WG2 shared insights
about new strategies to visualize and tracking EVs,
focusing on how to improve the routinely approaches
used, defining optimal criteria for EVs labelling and
imaging. All the participants had an in-depth overview
on the requirements and the state-of-the-art techniques
currently in use for the isolation, characterization and
tracking of EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: The transferable knowledge
acquired during the workshop ensures participants to
remain up-to-date with the advances in the field of
EVs. As our ultimate goal is to create a competence
centre in Southern Switzerland around the field of EVs,
the workshop was an invaluable opportunity to inten-
sify collaborations between resident laboratories and
broaden the scientific exchange with laboratories of
the experts hosted during the event. Given the success
of this first workshop we are already working to pre-
pare the second edition and make the event a recurring
appointment.

interdisciplinary clinical EV interest has created the
need for increased standardization and access to the
appropriate technologies to uphold these standards. As
the first core facility in the USA with the sole intention
of creating a space where users can both isolate and
characterize EVs, we provide a central location for the
facilitation of EV research via access to multiple tech-
nologies (both established and emerging) such as resis-
tive pulse sensing, nanoparticle tracking analysis,
ultracentrifugation, high-performance liquid chroma-
tography, flow cytometric analysis of EVs and addi-
tional immune or fluorescence-based EV characteri
zation techniques.
Methods: We surveyed a group of leading scientific inves-
tigators and researchers in varying stages of their scientific
careers in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US. The survey
data demonstrate applications of greatest current and
future interest to be employed in a shared lab resource.
Results: The current demand is highest for isolation
services, ultracentrifugation and NTA, with a gradually
increasing demand for immunophenotying analyses
such as the ExoView chip array, fluorescent NTA and
flow cytometry. We additionally present strategies and
data-based examples of how shared resource facilities
can facilitate multifactorial and rigorous EV character-
ization in accordance with MISEV guidelines, and
encourage collaboration among EV researchers.
Summary/Conclusion: In order to answer the larger
remaining questions in the EV field such as the isola-
tion of specific EV subsets, EV tracking between cells
and the use of EVs for biomarker discovery and drug
delivery, it is essential that shared resource facilities
interact not only with investigators, but with each
other to integrate the necessary resources to progress.

Programme to assess the rigour and reproducibility of extracellular vesi-
cle-derived analytes for cancer detection
Matthew Young and Sudhir Srivastava
National Cancer Institute, Rockville, USA
Introduction: Cancer cells release more EVs than normal
cells and EVs secreted from tumour cells can promote
tumour progression, survival, invasion and angiogenesis.
The EV cargo may mirror the altered molecular state of the
cell of origin. Therefore, EVs have potential for the devel-
opment of non-invasive markers for early detection of
cancers. EVs and their cargo also have the potential to be
multiplexed with other molecular markers or screening
modalities (e.g., imaging) to develop integrated molecu-
lar-based computational tools for the early detection of
cancer.
One challenge with using EVs as a biomarker is the
lack of robust and reproducible methods for the isola-
tion of a pure vesicular population. There is a lack of
clear consensus for an optimal method of isolation of a
pure EV population that is devoid of contamination
with similar-sized vesicles of different origins. There is
also
a
lack
of
standards
to
ensure
rigour
reproducibility.
Methods: The current funding opportunity announce-
ment (FOA), PAR20-053, is promoting research on the
isolation and characterization of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) and their cargo for the discovery of biomarkers
to predict cancer and cancer risk.
Results: The previous cycle of this FOA, PAR16-267/
277, successfully funded 7 R01 and 4 R21 grants. These
awards are focused on proteomics profiling of EVs,
effect of methodological and biological variability,
asymmetric-flow
field-flow
technology,
therapeutic
monitoring, LSS and SERS lab on a chip optical spec-
troscopic, EVs in obesity-driven hepatocellular carci-
noma,
nanoscale
structure
and
bio-molecular
heterogeneity, urinary EV DNA, and EV markers in
paediatric cancers.
Progress from these awardees have shown separa-
tion of two discernible exosome subpopulations and
identified a distinct nanoparticle, the exomere (Nature
Cell Biology, 2018); and have shown that large-EVs
contain the entire genome of the cell of origin, includ-
ing cancer-specific genomic alterations (Journal of
Extracellular Vesicles, 2019). Protocols that critically
evaluate and refine the existing methodologies to
improve utilization of EVs in clinical use have been
shared (Nature Protocols, 2019).
Summary/Conclusion: Drs. Sudhir Srivastava and
Matthew Young are the program directors for the
PAR which began accepting applications on 5 January
2020. This and other EV funding opportunities will be
discussed.

Introduction: Early detection of cancer as well as
monitoring cancer treatment are important to improve
cancer care. Diagnostics for cancer are mainly based on
tissue biopsies and re-biopsy during treatment is chal-
lenging. Moreover, current diagnostics are expensive,
time-consuming and have low-throughput. Therefore,
liquid biopsies are expected to bring the next break-
through in cancer diagnostics. In liquid biopsies
tumour-secreted material is isolated from body fluids
and subsequent analyses thereof allow for non-invasive
diagnostics. One type of tumour-secreted materials are
extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are schedded from
tumour cells. EVs are surrounded by a lipid bilayer,
whichs composition resembles the plasma membrane
of their parental cell. As many tumours are driven by
over-expression or upregulation of transmembrane
proteins e.g. growth factor receptors, detection of the
later on EVs holds promise for early tumour detection
and treatment monitoring.
Methods: For the immuno-PCR EVs were first affinity-
captured on magnetic beads, allowing immobilization
of purified EVs as well as EVs secreted into cell culture
medium or spiked into plasma. Afterwards each sample
was divided and affibody-DNA-conjugates directed
against different targets were added. Affibodies are
small affinity proteins, which often are developed as
high affinity binders for tumour imaging, making them
suitable probes in the presented assay. After washing,
the bead-EV-affibody-DNA-complexes were analysed
for the immobilized DNA-amount via qPCR.
Results: Via the presented immuno-PCR EVs secreted
from the non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1975 as
well as the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 were ana-
lysed. The immuno-PCR method allowed the detection
of the tumour-associated membrane receptors epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFR), receptor tyrosine-
protein kinase ERBB2/Her2 and insulin-like growth
factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). Different levels of mem-
brane receptors depending on the EV source and con-
centration were detected.
Summary/Conclusion: The presented immuno-PCR
showed to be a comparably fast and robust method
for detection of tumour-associated membrane recep-
tors on EVs derived from cancer cell lines with med-
ium through-put and is currently further developed
into a method for liquid biopsy for non-small cell
lung cancer patients.

Heterogeneity in EV cargo expression measured by single vesicle flow
cytometry
John Nolan and Erika Duggan
Scintillon Institute, San Diego, USA
Introduction: Introduction. EVs produced by cells can
originate from different cellular compartments and
EVs in complex biofluids may originate from many
different cell types. Traditional biochemical analysis,
which reports on the total composition of all EVs in a
sample can’t adequately resolve this heterogeneity.
Single vesicle analysis methods can, if they have the
necessary specificity, sensitivity and speed. Flow cyto-
metry (FC) is capable of rapid and quantitative analysis
of individual particles, but conventional FC-based
assays lack the specificity and sensitivity to measure
individual EVs. Assays that combine sensitive instru-
ments with EV-selective sample staining can measure
individual EVs with accuracy and precision. To better
understand the nature and origins of EV diversity, we

(293 T, A431, U87, THP-1, SH-SY5Y) were used neat
or enriched by standard methods including differential
centrifugation or ultrafiltration. EVs from platelets
(PLT) and red blood cells (RBC) were induced by
ionophore treatment of washed cells, and measured in
diluted supernatant. EVs were stained with a mem-
brane-selective dye and fluorescence-labelled antibo-
dies using a commercial vFC assay kit (Cellarcus
Biosciences), measured using a commercial flow cyt-
ometer (CytoFlexS, Beckman Coulter), and data ana-
lysed using FCS Express v6 (De Novo Software).
Vesicle size, fluorescence intensity, and antibody bind-
ing were calibrated using appropriate vesicle and bead-
based standards and essential controls performed as
recommended
by

Results: Results. To assess the compositional heteroge-
neity of EVs, we first characterized the expression of
tetraspanins (TSs; CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82, CD151,
CD53, CD231) on EVs released from cultured cell line
and primary cell cultures. We find quantitative differ-
ences in the expression of TS on EVs from different cell
types that generally reflected the expression on the cell
of origin, with most EV types expressing detectable
amounts at least one of the common TS molecules
(CD9, CD63 or CD81) but generally not all three. In
EVs from some cell types, TS expression was uniform
across the EV population (CD9 on EVs), but EVs from
other cell types differentially expressed TSs, with some
EVs
expressing
no
detectable
TS
(RBC
EVs).
Intracellular cargo labelled genetically using fluorescent
proteins
(eGFP
or
mNeonGreen)
or
fluorogenic
enzyme substrates (CFSE) were measured in individual
EVs and revealed distinctive associations between EV
surface and internal cargo.
Summary/Conclusion: Conclusions. High resolution
measurement of cargo on/in individual EVs can help
interpret EV heterogeneity in terms of cell of origin,
signals carried, and effects on target cells.

Introduction: Fewer than 50% of patients develop both
vascular and valvular calcification, implying differential
pathogenesis. While circulating extracellular vesicles
(EVs) act as biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases,
tissue-entrapped EVs are implicated in early minerali-
zation but their contents and function are unstudied.
We developed an innovative method to isolate and
study EVs from fibrocalcific tissue and investigated
entrapped
EV
cargoes
in
human
cardiovascular
diseases.
Methods: Human carotid artery endarterectomies and
stenotic aortic valves were obtained from 27 donors
under IRB-approved informed consent. Tissues under-
went enzymatic digestion, ultracentrifugation, and a
15-fraction OptiPrep density gradient. Global proteo-
mics was performed on intact tissue, each OptiPrep
fraction, and EV-enriched pooled fractions; the latter
also underwent miRNA-seq. Fractionated samples were
also studied by CD63 immunogold electron micro-
scopy

and

analysis
(NTA). High confidence miR targets were predicted
by

utilized
the
BioCarta/KEGG/Reactome databases, and protein-pro-
tein interaction networks were built in STRING.
Results: Vesicle-associated pathways were increased

proteins

to

arteries
and
valves
(n = 1,411). Proteomics found 24 EV markers to be
highly enriched in the four least-dense OptiPrep frac-
tions of arteries and valves, while extracellular matrix
and mitochondria were predominant in denser frac-
tions, as confirmed by TEM/NTA. Proteomics and
miRNA-seq of tissue EVs quantified 1,104 proteins
and 123 miR cargoes linked to 5,182 target genes.
Pathway networks of proteins and miR targets com-
mon to artery and valve tissue EVs revealed a shared
regulation of Rho GTPase and MAPK intracellular
signalling cascades. 179 proteins and 5 miRs were

Introduction: To investigate the possible mechanism
of MiR-20a regulating the expression of exosome CD82
on proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis
of gastric cancer, and to study the application value of
CD82 in the early diagnosis and prognosis of gastric
cancer.
Methods: The gastric cancer cell line MGC-803 was
used as the research object. The exosomes were
extracted from the culture supernatant of MGC-803
by exosome extraction kit. The extracted exosomes
were identified by transmission electron microscopy
and Western blotting. The expression of CD82 in exo-
somes was detected by ELISA. The expression of CD82
in exosomes and CD82 in whole blood and serum were
detected by Western Blot. They were randomly divided
into blank group (MOCK) and miR-20a lentivirus
experimental group (miR-20a group). The lentivirus
control group (miR-20a/Con) was transfected into
cells. qRT-PCR was used to verify the status of miR-
20a after transfection; Western-blot was used to detect
the expression of CD82 and downstream ERK1/2, AKt
and m TOR proteins; MTT assay, cell colony formation
assay, Transwell migration assay for cell proliferation,
invasion, and migration. A nude mouse xenograft
model was constructed to observe the growth of trans-
planted
tumours,microvessel
density
(MVD)
was
detected by immunofluorescence, and distant metasta-
sis was recorded.
Results: The expression of CD82 in exosomes was
detected by ELISA and Western Blot. The expressions
of CD82, Akt, ERK1/2 and m TOR in miR-20a group
were significantly lower than those in miR-20a/Con
and MOCK groups. CD82 protein is positively corre-
lated with downstream protein levels.The growth rate
and cell invasion ability of miR-20a group were signif-
icantly lower than those of miR-20a/Con group and
MOCK group. The weight of the nude mice in the
MOCK group and the miR-20a/Con group decreased,
while the weight loss in the miR-20a group was not
significant. The tumours in the miR-20a/Con group
and the MOCK group showed invasive growth accom-
panied by abundant microvessels, while the miR-20a
group had smaller tumour volume and uniform cell
distribution. Only a small amount of microangiogen-
esis was observed, and no obvious necrotic area was
observed.
Summary/Conclusion: miR-20a affects the prolifera-
tion, invasion, migration and angiogenesis of gastric
cancer mediated by Akt/ERK/m TOR signalling
pathway by regulating the expression of exosome
CD82.

Introduction: Nanoscale flow cytometry (FC) and
mass spectrometry (MS) are useful for profiling EV
surface proteins and performing bulk EV proteomics,
respectively. This study sought to develop pre-analyti-
cal and analytical pipelines for EV protein profiling
that are applicable to clinical studies.
Methods: To optimize plasma EV detection and quan-
tification by FC, modifications of instrument settings
and serial dilutions of platelet-free plasma (PFP) and
antibodies were tested for improved separation of sig-
nal from noise and reduction of event coincidence and
swarming.
The
high-performance
flow
cytometry
(HPFC) platform was used to assess the effect of time
(1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 24, 48 or 120hrs) between blood draw
(into ACD, NaCit, EDTA or heparin) and blood pro-
cessing, on ex-vivo release of EVs from blood cells.
Label-free MS was used to examine the intensity and
breadth of identified proteins in plasma EVs purified
using several density and size separation methods,

either manually or automated, along with various buf-
fer conditions.
Results: EV event aborts were minimized at a PFP
dilution, prior to staining, of 1:10 and by using a
narrow cytometer window extension. Target EV sig-
nals were distinct from noise and were Triton X-100
labile. The most significant changes in plasma EVs
were associated with platelet-derived fractions, use of
heparin and >5-hour delay before blood processing.
Yet, platelet EV numbers did not significantly change
for up to 24 hrs in citrated and EDTA plasma. Higher
overall coverage of known EV proteins and a fivefold
increase in number of uniquely identified proteins
were observed in MS profiling of EVs prepared by a
combination of ultracentrifugation (UC) and manual
size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) compared to
preparation by FPLC on Capto Core 700/Superose 6
resins. UC/SEC was better than direct SEC at redu-
cing contamination by excipient plasma proteins.
Column buffers with trehalose increased EV protein
recovery while adding protease inhibitors had mini-
mal effect.
Summary/Conclusion: With our optimized HPFC
protocol, we established that blood EV numbers
remain stable for up to 24 hrs in ACD or EDTA and
that UC+SEC with trehalose-containing buffer result in
high canonical EV protein recovery. We are applying
these
workflows
to
investigate
cancer-associated
changes in plasma EV protein cargo.

Introduction: The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harri-
sii), the largest living carnivorous marsupial is endan-
gered because of two transmissible cancers: Devil Facial
Tumour Disease (DFTD) one and two. Current efforts
to manage DFTD are hindered by the lack of a precli-

for
DFTD. Detecting DFTD
infection is only possible once tumours are noticed,
too late to stop DFTD progression. A preclinal test
could tell us about unknown components of DFTD
pathogenesis, such as latent period and host-tumour
dynamics.
Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by most
types of cells under both physiological and pathological
conditions. Exosomes have utility as diagnosis and
prognosis biomarkers in a range of diseases, including
cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate exo-
somes-based approaches towards a preclinical and pro-
gression biomarker for DFTD 1 and 2 in Tasmanian
devils.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from three different
DFTD-1, DFTD-2 and devil fibroblast cell lines by size-
exclusion chromatography. Likewise, exosomes were
isolated from plasma of healthy and diseased devils.
To determine the size and morphology of exosomes,
samples
were
imaged
with
transmission
electron
microscopy. Exosomes isolated from cell lines and
devil plasma were analysed with mass spectrometry to
characterise proteins and determine their differential
expression between the cell origins, and healthy and
diseased animals.
Results: This study identified the presence of myelin
proteins in exosomes from DFTD cells relative to fibro-
blasts, which are diagnostic of DFTD. Additionally, we
found that exosomes derived from DFTD-2 abundantly
express the inhibitory checkpoint molecule CD200 rela-
tive to exosomes from DFTD-1 cells and devil fibro-
blasts, indicating a potential candidate for a differential
diagnosis between tumours. Moreover, exosomes from
DFTD cells present a greater amount of proteins related
with metastasis in comparison with fibroblast exosomes,
such as integrins. Finally, we report the protein expres-
sion profile of exosomes from healthy and diseased
devils, showing clear differences between them and the
presence of immunosuppressive and metastasis proteins
in animals in late stages of the disease.
Summary/Conclusion: DFTD-exosomes may provide a
non-invasive diagnosis tool to detect early stages of
DFTD in Tasmanian devils to facilitate the prevention
of the disease. Furthermore, DFTD-exosomes may have
utility as a prognosis biomarker, determining late stages
of the disease using a simple a blood test, which would
facilitate monitoring of wild populations. This project
will provide long-term benefits for the future of the
devils and encourage exosome-based solutions for
other future wildlife disease outbreaks.

Introduction: Despite the increased understanding of
EVs, from involvement in disease pathophysiology to
therapeutic delivery, improved molecular tools to track
biodistribution are largely lacking. Current approaches
used for EV labelling lacks sensitivity and specificity.
Here, we have explored bioluminescent labelling of
EVs to achieve a highly sensitive system for absolute
in vivo quantification and tracking of exogenous EVs at
low cost and in a high throughput manner.
Methods: EV-producing cells were genetically engi-
neered to express various tetraspanin-luciferase fusion
proteins. EVs purified by UF-SEC from these cells were
characterized by NTA, multiplex bead-based array, TEM
and WB, followed by luciferase assay to determine the
labelling efficiency. For in vitro applications cell lysate
from treated cells or the conditioned medium were sub-
jected to luciferase assay. For in vivo applications two
different methodologies were applied to determine bio-
distribution; either by non-invasive real time in vivo
imaging using IVIS or by luciferase assay on harvested
tissues for absolute quantification of injected EVs.
Results: We initially performed a systematic compar-
ison of five different luciferases for endogenous label-
ling of EVs and identified NanoLuc and ThermoLuc as
lead candidates. We applied this technology to monitor
in vitro cellular uptake and observed cell type differ-
ences in cellular uptake of engineered EVs. In addition,
we also observed an effect of different culturing condi-
tions on exocytosis kinetics. For in vivo application, we
applied the NanoLuc labelling strategy to determine the
pharmacokinetics and effect of different routes of injec-
tion on EV distribution. Our results indicated a rapid
uptake profile of administered EVs in different tissues
with liver, spleen, and lungs being the primary recipi-
ents. We also observed similar results upon tracking in
vivo biodistribution in real time immediately after
administration. Finally, we show how different subpo-
pulations of EVs differ in their in vivo biodistribution.
Summary/Conclusion:
Overall,
NanoLuc
and
ThermoLuc labelling of EVs holds great potential for
various in vivo and in vitro applications. In addition, it
can enable the simultaneous detection of different sub-
populations of EVs in vivo, which may aid in our
understanding of different sub-populations and their
behaviour in vivo. Apart from monitoring therapeutic
EVs, with one simple modification this platform offers
great potential for tracking tumour derived EVs both
in vivo and in vitro and thus could aid in the develop-
ment of anti-tumour therapies.

Introduction: [INTRODUCTION] In our research
group, developing therapeutic techniques based on
extracellular vesicles (exosomes, EVs) by effective
usage of peptide chemistry to deliver therapeutic/diag-
nostic molecules into targeted cells has been focused.
In this presentation, modification techniques using
biofunctional peptides such as arginine-rich cell-pene-
trating peptides [1], artificial coiled-coil peptides with
receptor targeting [2], and cell-penetrating sC18 pep-
tides [3] derived from cationic antimicrobial protein,
CAP18 for cancer targeting with macropinocytosis
induction, on the EV membranes will be introduced.

I will also show effects of lyophilization of the peptide-
modified EVs on their biological activity [4].
Methods:
[METHODS]
CD63
(EV
marker)-GFP-
fusion protein expressed EVs were used for cellular
EVs uptake assessments. All biofunctional peptides
were synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase method.
Results: [RESULTS] Macropinocytosis with actin reorga-
nization has been shown to be crucial for cellular EV
uptake [5]. We developed the methods for modification
of arginine-rich CPPs or sC18 peptides on EV mem-
branes using chemical linker techniques, and for example,
arginine-rich CPPs modification can induce proteogly-
can-clustering (e.g. syndecan-4) and macropinocytosis
signal transduction [1]. The artificial leucine zipper pep-
tide-modified EVs recognize the peptide-tagged epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on targeted cells,
leading to macropinocytotic cellular EV uptake [2]. In
addition, lyophilization is a useful technique for long
term storage, however, we found that lyophilization nega-
tively affected biological functions of encapsulated pro-
teins in the EVs after their cellular uptake [4].
Summary/Conclusion: [CONCLUSION] These tech-
niques and findings will contribute to development
for the EV-based intracellular delivery systems.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) bud from the
plasma membrane (PM) as microvesicles (MV) or arise
from the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVB) with
the PM to release intralumenal vesicles (ILV) as exo-
somes. The variety of bioactive molecules carried by
EV imparts diverse functionality to EV in intercellular
signalling. The biogenesis and extracellular release of
these specialized messenger organelles is not well
understood. To investigate, we studied endothelial
cells that line the inside of blood vessels, known to
release EV that support angiogenesis.
Methods: Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) were examined by thin-section electron
microscopy (EM), serial sectioning and immunogold
labelling to study the structure and composition EV
release sites. To obtain optimal views of cellular ultra-
structure, cells were preserved by fast-freezing and a
freeze-substitution.
Results: A potential release site was identified in EM
thin sections as a discrete domain, up to several
microns long, on the otherwise smooth HUVEC PM,
where numerous bulbous membrane protrusions with
thin necks were clustered. The cytoplasm in these pro-
trusions was enriched with MVB and other vesicles and
appeared to be on the verge of pinching off to release
multi-compartmented MV (MCMV). Consistent with
this notion, in the neighbouring extracellular space, a
plethora of MCMV of 300–1200 nm with ultrastruc-
tural features matching the bulbous protrusions were
observed, supporting the concept that MCMV bud
from the release site. Serial sections confirmed that
these extracellular MCMV were independent of cells
and not linked by nanotubes or other processes.
Remarkably, fusion of MVB with the MCMV mem-
brane was directly observed, presumably caught in the
act of releasing ILV (exosomes) from the MCMV.
Immunogold labelling for EV markers is being used
to identify proteins enriched at release sites and on
released MCMV.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, 1) MCMV bud
from localized sites on the endothelial PM, 2) MCMV
contain MVB, and 3) fusion of MVB to MCMV to
release exosomes occurs extracellularly. MCMV can
now be evaluated as a potential source of exosome
and EV release that occurs after budding from the
cell of origin, adding new layers of regulation to
when, where and how EV are assembled and released.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles have tremendous
intrinsic therapeutic potential. However, the limited
availability of production cell lines presents a barrier
to scaled EV production and novel EV discovery.
Indeed, EV sources have been largely confined to a
handful of cell types with the vast majority consisting
of MSC EVs. To overcome this limitation, we devel-
oped a diverse library of hundreds of clonally pure
and scalable progenitor cell lines that provides an
alternative
resource for
EV drug discovery and
production.
Methods: We harnessed the capacity of human plur-
ipotent stem cells (hPSC) to differentiate into virtually
any cell type by subjecting hPSC to a wide variety of
media and culture conditions to maximize the diversity
of partially differentiated cells. The resulting heteroge-
neous “candidate cultures” were plated at clonal den-
sity and further selected for self renewing and scalable
clones. Transcriptomic analysis indicated >200 distinct
progenitor lines. Cell fate potentials were mapped by
screening for cell type specific marker expression in
various differentiation conditions. EVs were produced
using cGMP methods (TFF and SEC) and character-
ized by NTA, TRPS, surface marker analysis, RNA and
protein content. Bioactivity assays included prolifera-
tion, migration, vascular tube network formation,
senolysis, and oxidative stress.
Results: The progenitor library contained >200 distinct
lines with diverse lineage fates including various types
of bone, cartilage, muscle,and fat cells, as well as all
blood vessel cell types. The lines displayed much longer
replicative lifespans (70–100pd) than primary cell lines
like MSC. Clonal purity minimized phenotypic drift
resulting in maintenance of cell identity, genome integ-
rity, differentiation capacity and bioactive EV produc-
tion over extended culture. EVs were highly diverse in
their RNA and protein cargo and bioactivity displaying
various degrees of migratory, proliferative, angiogenic
and senolytic activity. Library screening identified EVs
with higher angiogenic potency than primary adult
stem cell EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrated scalable and
stable production of bioactive EVs from a large pro-
genitor cell library. Library screening resulted in dis-
covery of novel angiogenic and senolytic EVs having
diverse RNA and protein cargo. We are currently creat-
ing a corresponding library of progenitor cell EVs to
accelerate discovery of novel EVs and their production
cell lines.

was funded in part by grants from the California

Introduction: Besides extreme potential in biomedical
applications, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also promis-
ing candidates to expand biophysical understanding of
membrane active biomolecules. Their complex bilayer
composition
allows
the
better
understanding
of
adsorbed proteins and protein coronas as well, which
sets of macromolecules will likely be key for advanced
EV targeted delivery. Considering cargo, membrane
active peptides are interesting as these can be both
drugs to be delivered, but can also facilitate cargo inser-
tion through lipid bilayers. However, at present very
little is understood regarding interactions between the
peptides and the EV lipid bilayer, and between peptides
and membrane associated proteins on EVs.
Methods: We have recently demonstrated, that EV
membrane adsorbed proteins and their interactions
can be studied by techniques such as polarized light
spectroscopy, microfluidic resistive pulse sensing mea-
surements and freeze-fraction transmission electron
microscopy [1]. Furthermore, initially we studied sev-
eral peptides with known antimicrobial properties and
found that these strongly interact with the EV surface
proteins, resulting in efficient removal of some from
the lipid bilayer [2].
Results: Here we present investigation of further EV-
peptide interactions also focusing on anticancer pep-
tides, which may be promising drug candidates for
targeted delivery. These studies allowed to gain insight
to novel functions of several peptides, such as melittin,
magainin, buforin, lasioglossin, temporin, but also pro-
vide a more detailed understanding on how EV protein
coronas, or EV bilayers are affected, to such extent that
they cannot exert their potential function as delivery
systems.
Summary/Conclusion: The above interactions are
expected to be interesting both for applicability, i.e.
for selecting suitable compounds for EV processing,
and also for curiosity-driven understanding of peptide
functions, and EV-biomolecule interactions. Based on
these we promote that peptide – EV interactions will
receive increased focus in EV-engineering.

A specific non-coding RNA in extracellular vesicles from induced neuro-
nal cells and epigenetic regulation of neurotransmission

Introduction: Our late-breaking finding is the identi-
fication of a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in extracellular
vesicles (EVs) from neuronal cells that is a natural
antisense transcript for the DBH gene and associated
with epigenetic changes and gene silencing. DNA
methylation in neurons is involved in memory and
neurological disorders (Science 2018 361 (6409)).
Earlier work found that during chronic brain infection
with Toxoplasma gondii induced a decrease in norepi-
nephrine levels and expression of the host DBH gene;
and the decrease is correlated with behaviours linked to
noradrenergic signalling (Infect Immun. 2019 87(2);
Infect Immun. 2016 84(2861)). DBH catalyzes the pro-
duction of norepinephrine from dopamine in noradre-
nergic neurons. We found that EVs from infected
cultures suppress transcription of the DBH gene and
hypermethylation of the gene in noradrenergic cells in
vitro. In this study, we identify a ncRNA in the EVs
from infected neuronal cells.
Methods: Neuronal cells were induced by infection
with Toxoplasma gondii and EVs purified on sucrose
gradients. EVs were characterised by electron micro-
scopy and used to treat rat and human neuronal cells
and expression levels of DBH mRNA and nascent DBH
gene transcription were measured. Induced EVs were
injected into the locus coeruleus of rats and DBH gene
expression was monitored. RNA purified from EVs was
screened for natural antisense transcripts (NATs) by
strand-specific RT-PCR.
Results: We found that EVs purified from infected
neuronal cultures induced transcriptional gene silen-
cing (TGS) and DNA methylation of DBH in recipient
neuronal cells. The induced EVs down-regulated DBH
gene expression >200-fold and induced DNA hyper-
methylation of the DBH gene. This could be induced in
the brains of recipient rats by intracerebral injection of
EVs. Using a panel of strand-specific primers, antisense
transcripts for the DBH gene were identified in
infected cells. This permitted us to examine the RNA
in purified EVs and identify a lncRNA in EVs selective
for EVs from infected cultures.
Summary/Conclusion: This is the first study to find a
specific neurotransmitter antisense lncRNA in EVs
associated with transcriptional gene silencing and epi-
genetic changes in the gene. This represents a different
type of neuron-to-neuron signalling than the classic
chemical and electrical neurotransmission. The find-
ings will enhance our understanding of neurological
disorders (ie. schizophrenia, epilepsy, drug addiction)
and how memory works.

dysregulation of CD4 + T regulatory (Treg) cell func-
tion is believed to be a major pathogenic factor.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) released by Treg cells in asso-
ciation with extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been
shown to participate in the block of pathological
immune responses by inhibiting the growth and cyto-
kine production of CD4 + T conventional (Tconv)
cells, but the molecular mechanism is still poorly char-
acterized. Aim of the present work was to evaluate
whether Treg cell-derived EV-associated miRNA sig-
nature is dysregulated in MS and whether this defect
may play a role in the development of autoimmunity.
Methods: Human Treg cells isolated from blood of
naïve to treatment relapsing-remitting MS patients
and healthy controls were in vitro stimulated and
released EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromato-
graphy and characterized by nanoparticle tracking ana-
lysis, electron microscopy and flow cytometry. EV-
associated miRNAs were quantified by traditional RT-
qPCR and droplet digital PCR for absolute quantifica-
tion. The actual EV-mediated passage of RNA mole-
cules from cell to cell was followed through RNA-
specific fluorescent staining and Treg-derived EV effect
on Tconv cell transcriptome was evaluated by RNAseq.
Results: In healthy conditions, the treatment of Tconv
cells with Treg-derived EVs was shown to cause the
specific repression of genes involved in the protea-
some-dependent proteolytic process, known to be cru-
cial for T cell activation. In MS, Treg-derived EVs may
have lost this capability as a direct consequence of a
significantly decreased expression of miR-142-3p, able
to target key factors of the proteasome system.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results unveil a novel
molecular mechanism for Treg-mediated maintenance
of self-tolerance based on EV-associated miR-142-3p
and its potential alteration in human autoimmunity.

Introduction: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a
neurodegenerative disease characterised by the deposi-
tion of misfolded proteins in the motor cortex and
motor neurons. Although a multitude of ALS-asso-
ciated proteins have been identified, few have been
associated with extracellular vesicle (EV) trafficking, a
form of inter-cellular communication. Additionally, the
role of EVs in ALS is undetermined, specifically in
relation to pathogenic stress granule formation, a
response to cellular stress involving aggregation of
non-coding RNAs and their RNA binding proteins.
Therefore, this study aimed to determine the proteome
of brain derived small extracellular vesicles (BDEVs)
isolated from ALS subjects and identify novel ALS-
associated deregulated proteins and their potential con-
tributions to pathogenic pathways in ALS.
Methods: BDEVs were isolated from human post-mor-
tem ALS (n = 10) and control (n = 5) motor cortex
brain tissues through an ultracentrifugation protocol
(Vella et al., 2017). Following thorough characterisa-
tion, BDEVs that successfully met the minimum cri-
teria
required
by
The
International
Society
for
Extracellular Vesicles were classified as EVs. The
BDEVs subsequently underwent mass spectrometry
analysis on the Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive HF with
Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano. Proteins identified to be
statistically significant differentially expressed then
underwent validation by western blotting.
Results: A panel of 16 statistically significant differen-
tially packaged proteins were identified in the ALS
BDEVs. This included several up-regulated RNA bind-
ing proteins and a down-regulated cell adhesion mole-
cule;
DHX30,
STAU1
and
VCAM1,
respectively.
Pathway
analysis
revealed
that
the
BDEVs
were
enriched in proteins associated with stress granule
dynamics, exosomal and lysosomal pathways.
Summary/Conclusion: The identification of the RNA
binding proteins in the ALS BDEVs suggests there may
be a relationship between ALS-associated stress gran-
ules and ALS BDEV packaging. The packaging of stress
granule associated RNA binding proteins into ALS
BDEVs may be an attempt by the cells to compensate
for lysosomal dysfunction caused by stress granule
accumulation, a feature of ALS. Thus, these results
highlight a potentially novel role for EVs in the patho-
genesis of ALS.

Introduction: Microglia cells are the resident macro-
phages of the central nervous system (CNS) and main-
tain
tissue
homoeostasis
under
physiological
conditions. During chronic inflammation and neuro-
degenerative diseases, this balance is lost. Studying
microglia in the CNS is difficult in part because micro-
glial markers like Iba1, CD11b, CD68 and CD45 are
also found on macrophages. Recently, TMEM119 was
reported be exclusively expressed by microglia cells in
both mouse and human CNS. We have sought to
determine whether brain-derived extracellular vesicles
(bdEVs) display Tmem119 and betray the state of
microglia of origin.
Methods: bdEVs were separated from human cortical
samples and characterized per MISEV2018 guidelines
by Western blot, NanoView, transmission electron
microscopy and nanoflow (NanoFCM). Tmem119
antibodies
were
tested
by
immunocytochemistry
(ICC) of microglia SV40 cells and differentiated U937
macrophage-like cells. LPS treatment was used to
mimic inflammatory conditions. A TMEM119 anti-
body was then chosen for microglial EVs capture
from total bdEVs. Efficiency was cross-validated by
Western blot.
Results: bdEVs from human cortex had typical EV
morphology and size distribution and expressed abun-
dant CD9 and CD81 but lower CD63. Cellular marker
GM130 was depleted in EVs vs tissue. Particle counts
number range from 10e7-10e8 particles/100 mg tissue
ICC revealed that TMEM119 was upregulated during
inflammation by microglial cells but not by macro-
phage-like cells. A TMEM119-EV+ population was
successfully separated by immunoaffinity.
Summary/Conclusion: An efficient and reproducible
protocol was used for bdEV isolation, and TMEM119
could be used to separate EVs of presumed microglial
origin. Further optimization is underway, with the goal
of using TMEM119 to identify microglial EVs and their
informative cargo in the periphery.

foetal mesencephalic neural progenitor cells is one of key therapeutic
factors for Parkinsonism multiple system atrophy

Introduction: We have successfully developed human
foetal mesencephalic neural progenitor cells (hmNPCs)
for long-term cultivation . The whole cultivation process
of tissue preparation, cultivation, and cryopreservation
has been established using strict serum-free conditions
under a good manufacturing practice. Long-term-culti-
vated hmNPCs retained stemness and hmNPCs have
excellent differentiation efficiency into dopaminergic
neurons. hmNPCs reversed impaired motor function
in a rodent model of parkinson’s disease (PD). Based
on the promising results in animal experiments, the
clinical trial is under way (NCT01860794).
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is one of fatal neu-
rodegenerative diseases with a combination of progres-
sive autonomic nervous system disorders, Parkinson’s
syndrome, and cerebellar pyramid syndrome. There are
three types of MSA such as MSA-A, MSA-C, and
MSA-P. In case of a MSA-P type, it is difficult to
diagnose due to the similarity of symptoms with
Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Methods: In Vitro and In Vivo animal MSA Model
were
established
and
Rotational
behavioural
was
performed.
NPC cells were isolated and cultured based on
Moon et al.
miRNA sequencing (BGI) was performed and sev-
eral bioinformatics analyses were done.
Results: Based on the finding that hmNPCs exhibited
therapeutic
effects
on
PD,
we
hypothesize
that
hmNPCs will have a therapeutic effect on MSA-P,
where sympotoms are largely common with PD. As
expected, transplanted hmNPCs survived, integrated,
and differentiated in to dopamine neurons in the host
brain, consequently leading to the functional recovery
in the MSA-P model. To further investigate the ther-
apeutic key factors of hmNPCs in MSA-P, miRNA
sequencing of the extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted
from hmNPCs was performed.
We found that miR-451a highly expressed in the
NPC-derived EVs is one of key regulators of inflamma-
tory response via NFkB pathway. We further experimen-
tally demonstrated that miR-451a had anti-inflammatory
effect on cells of MSA-P condition such that the level of
CX3CL1 expression and its receptor, CX3CR1 were both
decreased in the MSA-P modelled cells and in severe
inflammatory environment in MSA brain.
Summary/Conclusion: Our study first showed that
miR-451a in hmNPCs-EVs is one of key therapeutic
factors for the recovery of brain damage through
immuno-modulation in MSA-P.

Introduction: Oxidative insults are known to be
involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). We have previously demonstrated that some
blood-based redox-signature were associated to the
cognitive scores in mild cognitive impairment patients
and in AD (Perrotte et al., 2019). The aim of this study
was (1) to evidence the presence of some oxidative
markers in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), and
(2) to compare to their plasma levels.
Methods: Plasma samples from healthy, MCI and AD
patients were from the Memory Clinic of Sherbrooke
(Québec, Canada). AD patients were stratified in three

groups (moderate, mild and severe) according to the
MMSE and MoCA scores. Total plasma extracellular
vesicles (pEVs) were isolated from plasma with the
Total Exosome Isolation reagent (Invitrogen™by Life
Technologies Inc.). pEVs were then characterized by
electronic microscopy, NTA, DLS and Western Blot.
Antioxidants apolipoprotein J, D (apo J, ApoD), the
glyoxalase-1 and protein carbonyls were determined by
Western blot.
Results: In pEVs, we found that apo D levels were
higher in MCI patients but not in AD patients.
Protein carbonyls levels were higher later, in pEVs
from moderate and severe AD while apo J levels were
not different in pEVs from the five groups of patients.
In plasma, the pattern of apo J and apo D was
different. The levels of apo D was not different in the
five groups of patients while apo J levels were elevated
in MCI and in all AD groups. Protein carbonyls were
higher earlier from mild AD group, earlier than in
pEVs. The levels of the detoxifying enzyme glyoxa-
lase-1 were higher in pEVs than in plasma and were
significantly decreased in early AD as compared to
control subjects and MCI
Summary/Conclusion: These results demonstrate a
differential regulation of redox homoeostasis in plasma
and in pEVs from AD patients.

Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurological
disorder characterized by white matter demyelination
and extensive synaptic pathology. Recent studies have
shown synaptic loss in the grey matter of MS brains in
the absence of demyelinating lesions which could
account for disease progression independent of demye-
linating episodes. Opsonization of synapses with com-
plement
components
is
a
mechanism
by
which
phagocytic cells normally prune synapses, but, when
occurring in excess, it may underlie pathologic synapse
loss. We sought to identify blood-borne biomarkers of
hypothesized complement-mediated synaptic loss in
MS using circulating neuronal-enriched and astrocy-
tic-enriched extracellular vesicles (NEVs and AEVs).
Methods: NEVs and AEVs were immunocaptured in
parallel from the plasma of 60 MS patients (45 with
Relapsing Remitting, 15 with Progressive MS) and 31
healthy controls, targeting the neuronal-specific mar-
ker L1CAM and the astrocyte-specific marker GLAST,
respectively. We measured the protein levels of pre-
and post-synaptic proteins synaptopodin and synapto-
physin in NEVs using ELISAs and multiple comple-
ment cascade components (C1q, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C5,
C5a, C9, Factor B, Factor H) in AEVs using a Luminex
array.
Results:
Synaptopodin
and
synaptophysin
protein
levels in NEVs of MS patients compared to controls
were markedly reduced (2.5-fold; p < 0.0001 for both),
whereas multiple complement components in MS
AEVs were markedly increased (C1q: 2.5-fold change;
C3: 1.25-fold change; C3b/iC3b: twofold change; C5:
1.4-fold change; C5a: 1.4-fold change; Factor: 1.5-fold
change; p < 0.0001); differences were not observed in
total circulating EVs or neat plasma. Strikingly, we
found the NEV-associated synaptopodin/synaptophy-
sin and the AEV-associated complement levels to be
negatively correlated in people with MS (synaptopodin
vs: C1q, r = −0.7 and p < 0.0001; C5, r = −0.6 and
p < 0.0001; Factor H, r = −0.46 and p < 0.0002/synap-
tophysin vs: C1q, r = −0.75 and p < 0.0001; C5,
r = −0.65 and p < 0.0001; Factor H, r = −0.52 and
p < 0.0002), but not in controls.
Summary/Conclusion: Circulating EVs provide mar-
kers of synaptic loss and complement activation in MS
and suggest a link between astrocytic complement pro-
duction and synaptic decline.

precursors of AGEs and particularly N-(1-carboxy-
methyl)-L-lysine (CML), the most abundant AGEs.
MG induced tau hyperphosphorylation and causes hip-
pocampal damage and memory impairment in mice.
The aim of our study was to analyse the effects of
MG and GO on the neuroprotective, neurotrophic
factors, inflammatory and neurodegenerative markers
in the human cell line SK-N-SH and their release into
the neuronal derived-EVs.
Methods: Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were incubated in FBS
free media with MG and GO (0.5 mM) for 24 hours.
Neuronal derived-EVs (nEVs) from culture media were
isolated as previously described (Haddad et al. 2019).
nEVs were characterized by electronic microscopy,
NTA and by Western Blot.
Cellular and nEVs concentrations of BDNF, PRGN,
NSE, APP, MMP9, ANGPTL-4, LCN2, PTX2, S100B,
RAGE, DJ-1 and alpha synuclein were determined by a
Luminex assay from R&D Systems, Inc. Aβ1-40, Aβ1-
42, pTau T181 and total tau levels were measured also
with luminex assay from EMD Millipore Corp.
Results: We found that both AGEs precursors, at non
toxic concentration, reduced the neuronal levels of
NSE with no effect on BDNF, PTRX-2, LCN-2, DJ-1,
on neurodegenerative markers and on CML. GO
decreased the levels of PRGN, APP, ANGPL-4 while
the expressions of MMP-9 and ANGPL-4 were, respec-
tively lower and higher in the presence of MG.
MG and GO greatly reduced the release of LCN-2 by
neuronal cells in nEVs. BDNF and PRGN in nEVs
were reduced in the presence of GO. Both MG and
GO did not modify the release of NSE, APP, MMP9,
AGNTL-4, PTX-2, DJ-1, Aβ, pTau and CML in nEVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that
MG and GO differently affect the content of some
protein cargoes in nEVs and suggest that targeting
MG and GO may be a promising therapeutic strategy
to prevent neurodegeneration.

Introduction: Peripherally circulating brain-derived
extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their encapsulated
RNAs may serve as biomarkers for HIV-associated neu-
rocognitive disorders (HAND). However, rates of cigar-
ette
smoking
are
significantly
higher
in
HIV+
individuals than the general population, and smoking
can modulate the expression of these markers. To better
understand how cigarette smoke might modulate RNA
expression and EV release, we examined several CNS-
derived cell lines, representing astrocytes (U87 MG),
microglia (SV40), and oligodendrocytes (HOG).
Methods: Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by
bubbling through culture medium using a standardized
and published method. All cell types were exposed to either
0% or 50% CSE for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed by
MuseTM Cell Analyser, and EVs were isolated from cul-
ture conditioned media (CCM) by size exclusion chroma-
tography. The void (fractions 1–6), EV (7–10), and protein
(11–14) enriched fractions were pooled and concentrated.
EVs were characterized by transmission electron micro-
scopy (TEM), microfluidic resistive pulse sensing, and
Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated from cells and
circular RNA (circRNA) expression was assessed with a
circRNA Microarray.
Results: In response to CSE exposure, cell viability was
only slightly reduced for all cell types. TEM images vali-
date the presence of vesicles in the EV fractions, and their
absence in the void and protein fractions. Spectradyne
particle counts indicated CSE exposure substantially
increased the CCM particle count in the EV fraction
when compared with control. The presence of expected
EV markers (CD63, CD81, and TSG101) in the EV frac-
tions, and their absence in the void and protein fractions
was observed via Western blot. Intracellular circRNA
expression was significantly altered in all three cell lines.
Summary/Conclusion: CNS cells display physiologic
responses to CSE that include vesiculation pathways
and significant alterations in circRNA expression. We
are now studying the effects of CSE exposure on
circRNA expression in released EVs.

Introduction: Diagnosis and treatment of neuropsy-
chiatric disorders has made little progress in the last
half-century likely in large part due to the absence of a
scalable technique to profile the complex biological
activity of the brain in a living person. Exosomes are
nanovesicles 30–150 nm in size that mediate intercel-
lular communication and contain proteins, lipids, and
nucleic acids. It has been shown that brain derived
exosomes can be found in peripheral blood, but deter-
mining whether peripheral exosomes truly reflect
ongoing brain processes has to date not been possible
due to the absence of paired living brain and blood
specimens. Here, we present a novel method for paired
sampling of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
and peripheral blood from living human subjects for
exosomal RNA profiling.
Methods: Informed consent, approved by the IRB at
the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, was
obtained
for
patients
undergoing
Deep
Brain
Stimulation (DBS). Paired brain and blood specimens
were collected from 8 patients at two deep brain sti-
mulation (DBS) electrode implantation procedures: left
hemisphere followed by right hemisphere (total of 30
samples). We developed protocols to profile RNA from
exosomes of brain tissue extracellular matrix (ECM)
and peripheral blood. Exosomes were isolated via our
in-house protocol using ultracentrifugation. RNA was
then extracted from the exosomes using the Qiagen
miRNeasy Mini Kit protocol. Quality control (QC)
was performed to determine whether RNA obtained
was sufficient for next-generation sequencing.
Results: We demonstrate the safety of a novel proce-
dure to sample the brain in living human subjects.
Bioanalyzer traces and QC data show a mean total
RNA of 14.83 ng (range 1.72–137.17 ng) and no sam-
ples fell below the threshold required for library pre-
paration and sequencing (10 pg) determined by in-
house optimization on the SMART-seq v4 Ultra low
input kit.
Summary/Conclusion: To our knowledge, we have
performed the first study to sample pairs of DLPFC
and blood from living human subjects for exosomal
RNA
for
subsequent
next-generation
sequencing.
Ongoing analyses by our group promise to establish
peripheral exosomal RNA transcripts reflective of brain
activity. This non-invasive approach to probing neuro-
biology in the living human brain may facilitate the
development of exosome-based diagnostics for neurop-
sychiatric disorders.

Introduction: The relationship between obesity and
dementia is complex. While obesity in middle age
triples the risk of dementia 30 years later, many
patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are cachectic,
and a decline in adiposity portends progression of
dementia. This suggests adipose-derived factors are
important to nervous system homoeostasis. We pre-
viously showed that adipocyte-derived small extracel-
lular vesicles (ad-sEVs) induce pathologies critical to
developing obesity-related diseases and may provide a
mechanistic link between adiposity and dementia. We
hypothesized
that
altered
expression
of
ad-sEV
microRNAs involved in neurodegenerative pathways
is associated with more severe cognitive impairment
Methods: We studied serum and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from 19 participants with AD and 14 non-AD
controls. Ad-sEVs were isolated from samples by pre-
cipitation and immunoselection. Ad-sEV microRNA
expression
was
profiled
in
both
biofluids
and
compared.
Results: Serum and CSF microRNA expression corre-
lated strongly (r2 = 0.98). In serum, 189 microRNAs
were differentially expressed by a Fold Change ≥|1.1| in
the AD and control groups (p ≤0.1) and 251 microRNAs
were differentially expressed in CSF. Using Ingenuity
Pathways Analysis, we identified mRNAs expressed in
nervous system tissue that are targeted by the differen-
tially expressed microRNAs. The mRNAs map to 145
diseases and functions; neuronal cell death, neurodegen-
eration, and neuronal growth and developmental path-
ways are highly represented. Of the 189 differentially
expressed microRNAs in serum, 6 were moderately cor-
related with participants’ score on the Mini-Mental State
Exam, a test of cognitive function (rs = |0.488–0.609|). As
validation, RenCell Cx cortical derived neuronal stem
cells had decreased doubling time when exposed to ad-
sEVs from obese adipose tissue in vitro.

Summary/Conclusion: These findings support our
hypothesis that altered expression of circulating ad-
sEV microRNAs are involved in neurodegenerative
pathways associated with cognitive impairment. These
findings support using serum ad-sEVs as a surrogate
for CSF ad-sEVs. Functional validation is underway to
define the connection between ad-SEVs and AD.
Understanding the link between obesity and AD is
crucial as the population ages and the global obesity
epidemic grows.

Introduction: Coagulation derangements related to
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are com-
mon after TBI and contribute to secondary neural
injury. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from
all cell types, including platelets, endothelium, and
lymphocytes, which are responsible for DIC. We
hypothesized that specialized flow cytometry techni-
ques could identify a unique EV signature of DIC in
acute TBI.
Methods: Using a modified flow cytometry instrument
for detection of small particles, fluorescence panels
were created to assess for EVs from endothelial cells
(CD144, CD105), platelets (CD31, CD62p, CD41a,
CD42b), and erythrocytes (CD235) as well as brain
biomarkers (S100b, UCHL-1, GFAP, tau and NSE)
and T-lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD31). Samples
were prepared in Trucount tubes to determine volume
and treated with triton to confirm presence of EVs.
Results: 13/17 study patients and 16/20 controls were
male. 76% of study patients presented with a Glasgow
Coma Scale of 15. In the hypercoagulability panel, of
the 10 subsets with statistically significant differential
expression, 4 involved S100b+ and were elevated in
patients. Platelet-derived CD41a EVs and UCH-L1
EVs were significantly elevated in controls in 7 EV
subsets identified in the brain-specific panel. Finally,
CD3+/31+ EVs, derived from T-cells and identified in
the endothelial/T cell panel, are significantly lower in
patients suggesting CNS recruitment.
Summary/Conclusion: Endothelial and platelet/ery-
throcyte EVs may be elevated early after TBI. S100B-
carrying EVs are significantly elevated in circulation of
TBI patients; if reproducible, this signature profile may
be informative for diagnosis and risk stratification.
Further study is warranted to evaluate whether this
expression correlates with secondary microvascular
brain injury.

Introduction: Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are pre-
sent in essentially all biofluids and include all types of
RNA including miRNA. To enhance their stability out-
side of the cell, exRNAs are bound within ribonucleo-
protein
complexes
or
packaged
into
extracellular
vesicles (EVs). The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a
dynamic interface between the systemic circulation
and the CNS and is responsible for maintaining a stable
extracellular environment for CNS cells. The intent of
this study was to determine if EVs and their contents
are transferred from the peripheral circulation to the
CNS under conditions of an impaired BBB.
Methods: The BBB of mice was disrupted by hyperos-
molar mannitol injections. To validate that the BBB has
been disrupted with mannitol, intravenously-dosed
[13 C]-sucrose was increased in the forebrain by 14-
fold with mannitol compared to sham treated mice.
EVs were isolated from the forebrain, hindbrain and
spinal cord following gentle tissue lysis and differential
ultracentrifugation. EVs were validated by NTA, TEM

highly abundant in erythrocytes, was measured in the
EVs by qPCR.
Results: qPCR showed that miR-451a in CNS tissue

fold respectively. qPCR analysis of mRNA from
reported miR-451a target genes showed reduced target

Introduction: Opiates, such as morphine are used
extensively in the clinical setting owing to their bene-
ficial effects. Paradoxically, however, the prolonged use
of morphine often results in the development of toler-
ance, drug addiction, and ultimately leading to various
comorbidities associated with drug abuse. Although
great efforts have been made, at present there is no
treatment. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) plays a key role
in brain development, and brain cells fine-tuning pro-
cesses such as their proliferation, patterning, and fate
specification Recent findings have demonstrated that
inhibition of the SHH signalling prevents morphine
tolerance in rodent models. We thus hypothesize that
extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from morphine
exposed astrocytes and their cargo such as SHH are
critical for the development of morphine tolerance.
Methods: Mice were received either saline or chronic
morphine injection with escalating doses of morphine
for 5 days (subcutaneously; 10 mg/kg, day 1, 20 mg/kg
days 2–3, and 40 mg/kg days 4–5). The development of
tolerance was assessed by measuring the tail-flick
latency using Tail Flick Analgesia Metre (LE7106,
Harvard Apparatus). EVs were isolated using either
differential ultracentrifugation from astrocyte condi-
tioned media or gradient ultracentrifugation from
brain tissues. Western blotting and qPCR were per-
formed to determine the expression/activation of
SHH signalling pathway components.
Results: Our data showed that the levels of SHH pro-
tein were upregulated in morphine exposed astrocyte-
derived
extracellular
vesicles
(morphine-ADEVs).
Furthermore, SHH containing morphine-ADEVs acti-
vated SHH signalling in astrocytes. Our in vivo study
further demonstrated the upregulation of SHH, as well
as the activation of SHH signalling, in astrocytes of
morphine-administered mice.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings thus demon-
strated an autocrine mechanism for SHH pathway
activation in astrocytes associated with morphine tol-
erance. These findings could pave the way for the
development of SHH signalling pathway targeted
strategies in the prevention and treatment for sub-
stance use disorders.

Introduction: In the search for novel and non-invasive
biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), both circulat-
ing brain-derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) and
whole serum represent a valuable integration of the
currently used classification system. To face the tech-
nological challenge of EVs and serum analysis, we
propose the use of biophotonics techniques as reliable,
sensitive, fast and label free methods, potentially useful
in
tailoring
pharmacological
and
rehabilitation
treatments.
Methods: Circulating EVs, isolated by SEC, and serum
samples were collected from 10 healthy subjects (HC)
and 10 AD patients. All subjects were asked to com-
plete Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale and MRI
examination. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was
performed in order to detect EVs coming from neu-
rons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia and to
characterize each of them for the amount of ganglio-
side M1 (GM1), Aβ and TSPO expressed on their sur-
face. Serum analysis was performed using a Raman
microscope through the Surface Enhanced Raman
Spectroscopy (SERS) effect by mixing serum with Ag
nanoparticles. The Pearson’s correlation index was
used to assess the linear correlation between SPRi
data and clinical, MRI data and data obtained from
multivariate analysis (MVA) of SERS spectra.
Results: The SPR analysis of EVs showed that the
selected bioactive molecules are differently loaded on
neural EV populations and that their amount is
increased on total EVs in AD patients compared to
HC. We observed a significant correlation between
MVA data from SERS and the presence of Aβ on
neuronal and microglial EVs and of TSPO on neural
EVs, measured with the SPR array.
Summary/Conclusion: Thanks to our methodological
innovation we have verified the potentiality of EVs as
AD biomarkers, correlating biophotonics blood-based
analysis with clinical data. This platform could provide
a
powerful
tool
for
the
evaluation
of
AD
neurodegeneration.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a pivo-
tal role in brain homoeostasis and intercellular com-
munication in both physiological and pathological
conditions. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), EVs are key
players in the transfer of α-synuclein, with blood EVs
reported
to
undergo
proteomic
modifications.
Nonetheless, the detection and characterization of the
EV cargo is technologically challenging, limiting the
use of EVs as biomarkers so far. Herein, we propose
Raman spectroscopy for the label-free, bulk character-
ization of blood EVs in PD patients.
Methods: EVs were isolated by SEC and ultracentrifu-
gation from the serum of 18 healthy subjects (HC) and
22 PD patients. In all patients, the severity of PD was
evaluated with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS) part III and with Hoehn and Yahr
scores (HY). After proper EV characterization follow-
ing MISEV2018 guidelines, Raman analysis was per-
formed. The Raman microspectroscope was used with
a 532 nm laser in the spectral ranges 600–1800 cm-1
and 2600–3200 cm-1. Data from HC and PD patients
were compared by multivariate statistical analysis
(PCA-LDA).
Results: The Raman analysis of EVs highlighted differ-
ences in the biochemical profile of the two groups, with
the main variations in the spectral regions related to
proteins, lipids and saccharides. A preliminary estimate
of the accuracy of Raman profiling of blood EVs for
PD diagnosis was obtained, demonstrating an accuracy
of 71%. Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the
correlation between the Raman spectra and the clinical
scales (UPDRS and HY) used to stratify PD patients.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, the biochemical
signature of blood EVs can be detected by Raman
spectroscopy in PD patients and the EV spectral
modifications can be related to their clinical status.
These data suggest the possibility to use the Raman
profile of circulating EVs as a biomarker for brain
disorders, complementary to other specific molecular
markers.

Introduction: Peripheral immune alterations have
been described in psychiatric disorders such as schizo-
phrenia, depression, and autistic spectrum disorders. In
addition, behavioural changes have been observed in
various immunodeficient animal models. However, the
mechanisms by which peripheral immune system influ-

electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking assay, and
Western blotting. Brain cellular phenotypes were
assessed by immunofluorescent staining and gene
expression analysis. Behavioural phenotypes of Rag
KO and WT mice were examined in social interaction
test. In vivo transfer of EVs was performed to see its
effects on behavioural alterations of Rag KO mice.
Results: Rag KO mice displayed social behavioural
deficits, accompanying by enhance c-Fos immunoreac-

Summary/Conclusion: Our data showed that circu-
lating EV profiles were altered in mice lacking adap-
tive immune cells and, accordingly, showing social
behavioural deficits. Notably, our in vivo experi-
ments suggest that circulating EVs may contribute
to social behaviours. Further study will provide a

lying peripheral-to-brain immune communication

Introduction: The involvement of neuroinflammation
on ageing process is widely recognized. Extracellular
vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes, are able to cross the
blood-brain barrier and were related to neuroinflam-
mation. In this context, EVs have been considered a
potential mechanism of spreading molecules, including
microRNAs (miRNAs) that can promote mRNA degra-
dation or inhibit translation of their targets. Our aim
was to investigate the miRNA profile of circulating
total EVs during ageing process and their impact on
canonical pathways.
Methods: The Local Ethics Committee (Comissão de
Ética no Uso de Animais – UFRGS; n 29818) approved
all animal procedures and experimental conditions.
Plasma
was
obtained
from
Wistar
rats
(3
and
21 months-old) and total EVs were isolated. EV
microRNA isolation and microarray expression analy-
sis was performed to determine the predicted regula-
tion of targeted mRNAs.
Results: The analysis of global microRNA expression
revealed
48
differentially
expressed
microRNAs
(p < 0.05; fold change of ≥|1.1|); 18 miRNAs were
up-regulated and 30 were down-regulated in circulat-
ing total EVs from aged animals compared to young-
adult ones. A conservative filter was applied on
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and only experi-
mentally validated and highly conserved predicted
mRNA targets were used. IPA showed that neuroin-
flammation signalling is ranked among the top cano-
nical pathway impacted by differentially expressed
microRNAs
and
is
upregulated
in
aged
animals
(p
<
0.0001;
z-score:
3.413).
The
differentially
expressed miRNAs impacted 32 molecules in the neu-
roinflammation pathway. Interestingly, the ion chan-
nel GRIN2B is predicted to be up regulated and is a
target of many EVs miRNAs; in accordance with our
results GRIN2B was previously related to neurodegen-
erative diseases. Moreover, let-7a-5p is predicted to be
downregulated and target all the 32 molecules of the
neuroinflammation signalling pathway. Previous stu-
dies have correlated let-7a-5p and neurodegenerative
diseases.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that circulat-
ing total EVs cargo, specifically miRNAs, are altered by
ageing and impact neuroinflammation pathway, sug-
gesting the involvement EVs miRNA on ageing-
induced susceptibility of neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction: Bidirectional cell-cell communication via
paracrine mechanisms is critical for wound healing. A
new paradigm involving exosome-borne distinctive reper-
toire of cargo such as miRNAs has emerged as a predomi-
nant mechanism of cellular communication at the site of
injury. Unlike other shedding vesicles of similar size, exo-
somes selectively package miRNA by sumoylation of het-
erogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP).
Methods: Keratinocyte-derived exosomes (Exoκ) were
genetically labelled with fluorescent reporter (GFP)
using tissue nanotransfection. Purified, GFP-labelled
Exoκ were isolated from dorsal murine skin and
wound-edge tissue by differential ultracentrifugation
followed by affinity selection using magnetic beads.
Distributions of intact exosome were analysed using a
prototype
Jarrold-geometry
charge-detection
mass
spectrometer to directly measure differences in particle
mass and charge distributions. Complementary MS
and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)-MS experiments
have been used to characterize surface glycans and
glycopeptides. To selectively inhibit miRNA packaging
within the Exoκ in vivo, pH-responsive targeted siRNA
functionalized
lipid
nanocarriers
(TLNκ)
were
designed using materials that have prior history of
FDA approval for human use.
Results: An increase in mass/charge ratio with glycan
binding sites on the surface of wound-edge Exoκ were
observed compared to dorsal skin Exoκ. Wound-edge
Exoκ were selectively taken up by the macrophages in
the granulation tissue (n = 6). Keratinocyte targeting
siRNAhnRNP
functionalized
lipid
nanocarriers
(TLNκ) were designed with encapsulation efficiency
of 94.3%.
Application
of
TLNκ
encapsulating
siRNA
of
hnRNP (TLNκ/si-hnRNP) to murine dorsal wound-
edge significantly inhibited the expression of hnRNP
by 80% in epidermis compared to control (TLNκ/si-
control)(n = 10). Moreover, mice treated with TLNκ/si-
hnRNP showed impaired barrier function, with signif-
icant presence of macrophage in granulation tissue at
day 10, suggesting impaired conversion of macrophage
in the granulation tissue.
Summary/Conclusion: This work provides a novel
insight wherein exosomes of keratinocyte lineage are
recognized as a major contributor that directs macro-
phage conversion in granulation tissue for wound
healing.

Introduction: Recently, milk exosome (Mi-Exo) has
been focused particularly on the possibility of oral
distribution for therapeutic agents. However, stu-
dies related to the cosmeceutical effects associated
with Mi-Exo are fairly limited. The purpose of this
study is to suggest the anti-oxidant and anti-
inflammatory effect of Mi-Exo and possibility that
can be induced by scar free healing by micro RNA
in Mi-Exo.
Methods: The characteristics of the extracted Mi-Exo
were verified by size measurement, morphological
characteristics through Cryo-EM and western blot.
For antioxidant experiments, an ABTS assay was
performed. Next, mRNA expression through four
major cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS) was
used to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects. Finally,
cell migration assay was performed to confirm the
effect of scar-free healing and the detection of miR-

Results: Mi-Exo using 1% acetic acid extraction showed
the highest yield. The average size of the exosomes is
approximately 110 nm, confirmed the typical double
membrane vesicle. As a result of antioxidant experi-
ments, it was confirmed that the treatment of exosomes
of 10^10 particles showed about 65% antioxidant activ-
ity. When 10^10 particles were treated, RNA expression
of cytokines showed about 2 times more inhibitory
effect than control. ELISA test results also confirmed
that the concentration-dependent decrease. The activa-
tion of the raw cell less proceeded as the treated Mi-Exo
increased. The cell scratch assay cells did not close the
cells as the number of milk exosomes increased (wound
closing % of 10^10 particle = 4.7%). and miR-30b in
milk exosomes was detected at Ct value = 22.
Summary/Conclusion:
The
antioxidant
and
anti-
inflammatory effects of Mi-Exo showed the greatest
efficacy when 10^10 particles were treated. In addition,
it induced to scar free healing rather than wound heal-
ing. Mi-Exo has great potential as a superior natural
material in the future cosmeceutical field.

Introduction: Tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane
protein, initiates coagulation by binding and activating
coagulation factor VII (FVII). TF is associated with
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in saliva and urine, but it
is unknown whether also human milk (HM) contains
EVs exposing coagulant TF.
Methods: HM was collected from six healthy nursing
women with informed consent. EVs were isolated by
ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography
(SEC). The presence of TF antigen exposing EVs was
studied by Western blot, flow cytometry, cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM), and surface plasmon resonance
imaging (SPRi). The ability of TF exposing EVs to
trigger coagulation was investigated with a plasma
fibrin generation test (FGT), performed in the absence
or presence of antibodies against TF or FVII(a).
Results: Addition of HM to plasma shortened the
plasma clotting time, even when HM was highly
diluted. After ultracentrifugation of HM, both TF anti-
gen and TF activity were detected in the EV-containing
pellet. After SEC, TF antigen and TF activity were
present in the EV-containing fractions 8 and 9. The
presence of TF-exposing EVs in these SEC fractions
was confirmed by Western blot (CD9, CD63 and TF),
flow cytometry, SPRi, and FGT. In addition, the pre-
sence of EVs in HM was confirmed by cryo-EM.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrate the presence
of highly procoagulant TF-exposing EVs in HM.

Laura Soriano-Romaní, Joaquin Espí and Begoña Ruiz
Ainia, Paterna, Spain
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increas-
ing their application in a number of fields. Recently, it
has been shown that skin health may be affected not
only by commensal skin bacteria, but also by the EVs
that they secrete. However, because most of the efforts
have been directed to the characterization and evalua-
tion of EVs, the scaling up of the production process
remains a bottleneck at the industrial level. In this
work, the goal was to evaluate the potential applica-
tions of EVs produced by different probiotic strains
commonly used in the cosmetic field, considering the
economic and technical viability of the process.
Methods: To meet our goal, a standardized workflow
was defined to isolate EVs from probiotic strains such
as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, that have
demonstrated cutaneous immuno-regulatory effects.

The different bacterial strains were produced under
standard culture conditions. To isolate the secreted
bacterial EVs, different chromatographic techniques
were performed starting from clarified growth med-
ium. Then, EVs were evaluated in vitro for a number
of biological effects related with skin health.
Results: The EV yields obtained after downstream pro-
cessing were calculated for each strain and isolation
technique by means of nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA) and total protein content. Moreover, EVs were
visualized by electron microscopy. The in vitro evalua-
tion of isolated EVs was based on changes in the
expression of five biomarkers related with anti-ageing,
anti-inflammatory and whitening effects using distinct
skin cell types to identify possible cosmetic claims that
could be associated to each probiotic source.
Summary/Conclusion: The potential of EVs obtained
from probiotic strains as cosmetic active cell-free ingre-
dients was preliminarily assessed with this work, where
the process yield and cosmetic function were evaluated.
However, additional experiments will be needed in
order to increase and optimize the productivity of
each step of the EV manufacturing process.

Acerola derived exosome-like nanovesicles enhances the repair of ultra-
violet B-induced DNA damage in cultured skin fibroblasts

Kuroda
Tokyo Medical University, Shinjyuku, Japan
Introduction: Acerola (Melpighia emarginata DC.) is a
fruit is known to contain not only high amounts of
ascorbic acid but also various nutritional components
such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Previous reports
showed the acerola juices are able to confer protection
against Ultraviolet radiation B (UVB), to improve barrier
function of skin. UVB is the main cause of DNA damage
in epidermal cells, generating several types of pro-muta-
genic lesions, like cyclobutene prymidine dimers (CPDs)
and prymidine (6–4) prymidinone photoproducts (6–
4PPs): if not repaired, this DNA damage leads to skin
cancer. In this study, we investigated the biological prop-
erty of the acerola derived exosome-like nanovesicles
(ADENs), aiming to clarify the involvement of ADENs
in repair of UV-induced DNA damage.
Methods: Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs)
were purchased from Lonza Inc. The exosome-like nano-
vesicles were isolated from acerola juices using exoEasy
Maxi kit (Qiagen). The morphology and size distribution
of ADENs were checked by transmission electron micro-
scopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA,
NanoSight LM10, Malvern). NHDFs were exposed to
UVB (1 mJ/cm2) with pre- or post-ADENs. Effect of
UVB was assessed by examining cell viability, cell mor-
phology, and DNA damage levels through biochemical
assays, microscopy and protein expression studies.
Results: Purified ADENs were compatible with NTA
or TEM for assessing the nanovesicle size range and
concentration (200–400 nm). When NHDFs were
added with ADENs and incubated at 37°C for 48 h,
there was no effect of ADENs on cell proliferation of
NHDFs. We found that ADENs treatment to UVB
exposed NHDFs significantly reduced CPDs and 6–
4PPs DNA adduct formation. Present results showed
that ADEN treatment prevented UVB induced DNA
damage in NHDFs.
Summary/Conclusion: We confirm that ADENs have
the effect of repairing DNA damage caused by UVB.
These results provide that ADENs can be a new
source to protect human skin from UV-induced skin
cancer.

from disease, surgical intervention, or trauma remain
a major source of morbidity. Extracellular vesicles
(EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells
(MSCs) have been shown to improve wound healing,
especially via enhanced wound angiogenesis. However,
despite their clearly established potential, EVs have
limitations that may limit clinical relevancy, such as
low potency.
Hypothesis: Increased expression of pro-angiogenic
lncRNA HOTAIR within MSC EVs enhances their pro-
angiogenic effects and thus their wound healing
properties.
Methods: Methods: HOTAIR was overexpressed in
human
dermal
microvascular
endothelial
cells
(HDMECs) to determine any molecular or functional
pro-angiogenic effects. Anti-angiogenic miRNAs and
angiogenic mRNA levels were quantified by RT-
qPCR.
Effects
of
HOTAIR
on
proliferation
of
HDMECs was also determined. HOTAIR was then
loaded into MSC EVs by delivering a CMV-based
HOTAIR plasmid to MSCs for endogenous loading
via a concentration gradient. EVs were collected by
differential centrifugation. HOTAIR content within
EVs was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and RT-
qPCR.
Effects
on
migration
of
HDMECs
by
HOTAIR-loaded MSC EVs were determined using a
scratch assay.
Results: Results: Overexpression of HOTAIR decreased
miR-29 c and miR-107, while increasing VEGF and
HIF-1a. HDMEC proliferation was also increased in
HDMECs
overexpressing
HOTAIR
(p
<
0.01).
HOTAIR was visually confirmed in HOTAIR-loaded
MSC EVs by gel electrophoresis, but was undetectable
in unmodified MSC EVs. RT-qPCR confirmed a 900-
fold increase of HOTAIR compared to control MSC
EVs. HDMECs showed a more statistically significant
rate of gap closure when treated with HOTAIR-loaded
EVs (p < 0.01) than compared to control MSC EVs
(p < 0.05).
Summary/Conclusion: Summary: Loading lncRNA
HOTAIR into MSC EVs is achievable by a concentra-
tion gradient-dependent method and offers potential to
enhance the angiogenic properties of MSC EVs.

Introduction: Exosomes are vesicles secreted by many,
if not all, cell types and have been known about for
decades. Among larger micro vesicles that are pro-
duced directly from the cell membrane, the small
(30–150 nm), exosomes are similar in size to a virus
surrounded by a lipid bilayer. We and others have
demonstrated that exosomes contain proteins, lipids,
RNA, and DNA, making them promising materials for
diagnosing and treating diseases, including many can-
cers such as brain cancer. In addition, exosomes from
neurons and glial cells represent a novel type of inter-
cellular communication. However, their size makes
them hard to track with traditional fluorescence micro-
scopy. To address this, we developed photothermal
microscopy (PTM), which uses gold nanomaterial
labelling to track exosomes’ interaction with and effect
on cells/tissue.
Methods: Exosomes secreted by tumour cells and gen-
eral exosomes found in the blood were isolated using
differential ultracentrifugation or a commercially avail-
able kit (Invitrogen). Next, the exosomes were charac-
terized by (TEM), (NTA), and western blotting to
determine shape, size, morphology and the protein
profile in the exosomal membrane. After characteriza-
tion,
the
exosomes
were

nanoparticles via sonication. Next, the samples were
washed, and the exosomes were labelled with fluores-
cence dye to stain the membrane. After staining and
labelling, the exosomes were added to U87 cells in
culture and incubated for 3 h. They were then fixed
by 4% paraformldehyde and imaged by PTM.
Results: PTM found that exosome-cell interactions are
exosome-type dependent, as U87 cells took up exosomes
from other U87 cells but not human serum exosomes.
This suggests that exosome uptake is a selective process
and depends on the source of the donor cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Exosomes can be labelled with
gold nanoparticles via sonication then successfully
tracked by PTM to study the effect of exosome source
on exosome-cell interactions and communication. Cells
incubated with U87 exosomes took the vesicles up
rapidly, while cells incubated with serum exosomes
had little uptake. PTM will help us design selective
exosome-based strategies to treat different conditions,
including brain cancer and CNS damage.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are involved
in cell signalling and are present in a variety of cell
secretions such as milk, from which enormous amount
of EV can be purified, thus milk is an attractive raw
material for scaling up EV production for therapeutic,
cosmetic or other uses. Here we isolated EVs from the
whey fraction of goat´s milk and demonstrated that
such EVs can be loaded with molecules like polyphe-
nols and miRNA.
Methods: To achieve this, milk was collected from
lactating goats and fractionated by acidification and
centrifugation into whey and caseins. EVs were puri-
fied from the former fraction by serial centrifugation
and precipitation with commercial kit (Total Isolation/
Thermo
Fisher)
and
characterized
by
Electron
Transmission Microscopy (TEM), Western Blot to
identify surface markers and measurement of size
through Nanotracking Analysis. Once isolated, EVs
were loaded with different concentration of a spiked
synthetic miR39 or with the polyphenol curcumin.
miRNA or curcumin were co-incubated over night
with EVs at 4oC, precipitated and purified as described
above, with an additional washing and precipitation for
curcumin. Concentration of miRNA uploaded by EVs
was quantified using miR39 specific qPCR. Curcumin
was measured using a spectrophotometer at 420 nm.
Results: EVs isolated from whey had an average size of
120 nm, were positive for HSP70, CD9 and Alix. In
TEM, EVs were identified with their natural conforma-
tion and corresponding size to exosomes. qPCR
showed
a
significant
difference
of
expression
of
miR39 in relation to control (loaded with shame) and
the negative control (p < 0.05). Curcumin presence was
also confirmed after washing and precipitacion.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, milk EVs and
exosomes can be loaded with miRNA and a polyphenol
and can be used as alternative nanocarrier for acellular
therapies.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-
derived lipid membrane nanoparticles that serve as
messengers of intercellular communication, transfer-
ring bioactive molecules to recipient cells. EVs have a
natural therapeutic potential with high flexibility and
biosafety for employing natural and synthetic biomo-
lecules as therapeutic delivery vehicles. Considering the
importance of EVs, their isolation methods are still a
bottleneck. To get insights into the tissue-specific cargo
in vivo for complete exploitation of EVs as therapeutic,
biomarker and diagnostic tools, EV purification meth-
ods are critical. The aim of the study was brought
about to develop an efficient EV purification method
both in vitro and in vivo and to further investigate
function of EVs in cellular senescence.

Methods: To isolate tissue- specific EVs in vivo we
developed recombinant EVs by genetically fusing snor-
kel-tag to the CD81. The snorkel-tag enables on-col-
umn protease treatment for purifying EVs which does
not rely on traditional immunoaffinity purification
protocols using low pH or high salts solutions.
Results: We systematically evaluated the purification of
EVs harbouring snorkel-tag by employing different
methodologies. Our findings suggest that EVs harbour-
ing snorkel-tag indeed can be purified at high purity
without
altering
EV
biophysical
properties.
Furthermore, we expressed CD81-snorkel-tag under
p16ink4a promoter and were able to purify EVs
derived from senescent cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Finally, we are developing an
in vivo model with CD81-snorkel-tag under p16ink4a
promoter. This will provide us detail insights into the
EV cargo secreted from senescent derived cells, by
purifying EVs harbouring snorkel-tag under pathophy-
siological conditions, allowing us to develop biomar-
kers and therapeutic tools. Summarized, we have here
developed novel tool for studying content and function
of EVs in the context of ageing and disease. This tool
will now pave the way for studying the molecular
mechanisms underlying these EV functions in vivo.

Engineering exosomes with GATA-4
Jie Xu, Christian Paul, Yi-gang Wang and Meifeng Xu
University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, USA
Introduction: Exosomes, are small vesicles (30–150 nm)
secreted from cells that can transport and deliver of their
components such as lipids, proteins, DNA, mRNA, and
miRNA to target cells. GATA-4, a cardiac transcription
factor, has been shown to regulate differentiation, pro-
liferation, and survival of a wide range of cell types.
Delivering GATA-4 protein into ischaemic tissues may
be one of the most straightforward approaches to
improve cardiac function following myocardial infarc-
tion. Here, exosomes were engineered with GATA-4 by
infusing GATA-4 with exosome targeting peptide.
Methods: The open reading frame of mouse GATA-4
cDNA was ligated to XPACK lentivirus vector (XPACK-
GATA-4) and pLVX-EF1-IRES-Pouro lentivirus vector
(pLVX-GATA-4), respectively. HEK 293 cells were trans-
duced by lentivirus, then exosomes were isolated from
conditioned medium of HEK293 cells using ultracentrifu-
gation. Exosomes were identified using transmission elec-
tronic microscope (TEM), and the expression of GATA-4
was semi-quantified using western blot. The internaliza-
tion of exosomes was tracked via treating bEnd3 cells with
exosomes pre-labelled with PKH26.
Results:
(1) DNA sequencing confirmed the open reading
frame of GATA-4 cDNA in frame with exosome
target peptide.
(2) Isolated exosomes from HEK293 cells trans-
duced
with
XPACK-GATA-4
and
pLVX-
GATA-4 appeared as diverse round-shaped
entities and sized about 25–160 nm under TEM.
(3) GATA-4 was expressed in both cell lysis of
HEK293
cells
which
were
transduced
with
XPACK-GATA-4 and pLVX-GATA-4. However,
GATA-4 was only expressed in exosomes isolated
from HEK293 cells transduced with XPACK-
GATA-4, and not in exosomes from HEK293
cells transduced with pLVX-GATA-4.
(4) Exosomes expressing GATA-4 can be interna-
lized by bEnd3 cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Exosomes can be directly engi-
neered with GATA-4 and internalized by bEnd3
endothelial cells, which may be a potential effective
approach for delivery of GATA-4 to target cells.

engineered CHO cells to stably express constructs
enabling loading of GFP into EVs.
Methods: Tetraspanins are established markers of EV
identity. Accordingly, CD81 was selected as a tethering
point to generate EVs with GFP cargo and constructs
were generated via golden gate assembly. CHO cells
were stably transfected by electroporation and expres-
sion was verified with fluorescence microscopy and
western blotting. Growth in batch culture was moni-
tored to establish maximum viable cell densities for EV
harvest and recovered EVs were characterized by nano-
particle tracking analysis (NTA). Finally, uptake of
GFP-EVs was studied using time-lapse fluorescence
imaging in co-culture experiments.
Results: Strong localization of CD81-GFP was observed
at the cell membrane and blotting confirmed intact
tetraspanin fusion present at the expected molecular
weight. Additionally, cells were confirmed to retain
high GFP expression post-cryopreservation. Stable cell
pools were able to reach viable densities greater than 7
million cells/mL in batch culture and NTA allowed for
detection of GFP cargo even prior to EV isolation. EV-
mediated transfer of functional GFP to recipient cells
was found to occur over a period of hours.
Summary/Conclusion: Collectively, our findings indi-
cate that tetraspanins can be used as targets to package
recombinant protein cargo into mammalian derived
EVs. Moreover, CHO cells overexpressing cargo des-
tined for EVs can reach high cell densities and produce
functional EVs to facilitate yield challenges often asso-
ciated with EV recovery.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are consid-
ered
promising
for
therapeutic
applications.
EVs
resemble the cell membrane, allowing high biocompat-
ibility to target cells, while their small size makes them
ideal candidates to cross biological barriers. Despite the
promising potential of EVs for therapeutic applica-
tions, robust manufacturing processes that would
increase the scalability and consistency of EV produc-
tion are still lacking.
Methods: In this work, EVs were produced by
mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), isolated from dif-
ferent human tissue sources (bone marrow, umbilical
cord matrix and adipose tissue). MSC were selected as
these cells allow for a scalable production of EVs, while
displaying low immunogenicity. A Vertical-Wheel™
bioreactor system was implemented for the production
of MSC-derived EVs and compared with traditional
static systems. The obtained EV products were char-
acterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, atomic
force microscopy, zeta potential and Western blot.
Results: The bioreactor system allowed to obtain EVs
at higher concentration and productivity, as well as
more homogeneous size distribution profiles, when
compared to traditional static culture systems.
Functional studies were performed using breast cancer
and lung cancer cell lines. Proliferation assays allowed to
determine the dose-response profiles of these cell lines
when exposed to MSC-derived EVs. A bell-shaped profile
was observed for most cases, since raising the EV con-
centration lead to increased cell proliferation until a cer-
tain point (25–50 µg/mL), after which cell proliferation
was attenuated with increasing EV concentrations.
Summary/Conclusion: The bioreactor culture system
allowed a substantial improvement in the production of
MSC-derived EVs, while the obtained dose-response pro-
files will be valuable to determine the most appropriate
EV concentrations for anticancer drug delivery. Overall,
we demonstrate that this culture system is able to robustly
manufacture human MSC-derived EVs in a scalable man-
ner towards the development of novel therapeutic pro-
ducts such as anticancer drug delivery systems.

Introduction: Increasing evidence reveals the potential
role of extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and
liposomes, in lung regenerative medicine for the treat-
ment of lung diseases. Encapsulation and delivery of
potential RNA and microRNA targets into liposomes
and exosomes are attractive drug delivery methods, but
remain difficult to deliver to the pulmonary parench-
yma to reach target lung cell types. Here, we demon-
strate effective delivery and cellular uptake of exosomes
and liposomes to the pulmonary parenchyma via inha-
lation treatment in a murine model of idiopathic pul-
monary fibrosis.
Methods: Human lung stem cells (LSCs) were gener-
ated and expanded from healthy whole lung donors.
LSC-exosomes were purified via ultrafiltration and DiI-
labelled using Vybrant☐labelling solution according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. DsRed-labelled lipo-
somes
were
generated
using
Lipofectamine™
RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent and BLOCK-iT™
Alexa Fluor™Red Fluorescent Control according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. LSC-exosomes and
liposomes were delivered via nebulization to CD1
mice
with
bleomycin-induced
pulmonary
fibrosis.
Exosome and liposome delivery and biodistribution
were
visualized
4-
and
24-hours
post-treatment
through histological analysis. The study was approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of North Carolina State University and complied with
all national and state ethical standards.
Results: Exosome and liposome delivery to the pul-
monary parenchyma was confirmed by the presence
of DiI and DsRed fluorescence in lung histological
sections that penetrated the mucus-lined respiratory
epithelium. More exosomes and liposomes surpass
mucus-lined surfaces 24-hours post-treatment com-
pared to 4-hours post-treatment. Fluorescent colocali-
zation of exosomes and liposomes with alveolar type I
cells, alveolar type II cells, basal lung cells, and CD68
+ macrophages was observed through immunohisto-
chemistry analysis. More exosomes and liposomes
colocalize with these cell types 24-hours post-treatment
compared to 4-hours post-treatment.
Summary/Conclusion: LSC-exosomes and liposomes
penetrate the mucus-lined respiratory epithelium and
reach the pulmonary parenchyma through inhalation
treatment. LSC-exosomes and liposomes are uptaken
by alveolar epithelial cells, basal cells, and interstitial
macrophages with improved biodistribution 24-hours
post-treatment.

Transfection reagent artefact accounts for some reports of extracellular
vesicle function
Russell McConnell, Madeleine Youniss and Jonathan Finn
Codiak BioSciences, Cambridge, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicle (EV) functions are
frequently investigated by transiently transfecting cells
with plasmid DNA to produce EVs modified with
protein(s) or nucleic acid(s) of interest. However, EVs
and the DNA-complexes used to transduce cells are
physically similar, raising the possibility that they may
co-purify during differential ultracentrifugation, the
most common EV isolation procedure. Activities
attributed to EVs may therefore be due to contaminat-
ing DNA -transfection reagent complex.
Methods: EV producing cells were transiently trans-
fected with plasmid DNA encoding gene-editing or
split enzymes fused to EV-targeting protein sequences.
Differential and density gradient ultracentrifugation
were used to purify EVs from cell culture supernatant
or DNA lipoplexes from cell-free culture media.
Protein expression and localization to EVs was con-
firmed by Western blot. Cell lines stably expressing
fluorescent or luminescent reporters were used to
assess functional enzyme delivery in recipient reporter
cells.
Results: Reporter cells treated with ultracentrifuge pellet
material (UCP) from media of transiently transfected
cells showed robust and reproducible signal, however
fractionating the UCP with an iodixanol density gradi-
ent revealed that reporter activity was associated with
high-density fractions that were depleted in EVs. UCP
isolated from identical transfection conditions, but lack-
ing cells (and exosomes), showed identical biological
activity levels and distribution in iodixanol gradients,
suggesting that the activity was due to contaminating
transfection reagent complexes and not EVs. Serial
media changes on EV producing cells post-transfection
did not significantly reduce UCP activity on reporter
cells. Treatment with nucleases did not digest com-
plexed DNA, did not significantly reduce DNA levels
in the UCP as measured by qPCR, and did not decrease
activity in reporter cells treated with UCP from either
transfected cells or no-cell controls.

Summary/Conclusion: We find that DNA-transfection
reagent complexes are not separated from EVs using
differential
ultracentrifugation
and
that
common
approaches to remove such complexes, including
media exchanges and nuclease treatment, are ineffec-
tive. Due to the pernicious nature of the DNA-complex
in these cellular assays, it is likely that some reports of
EV function are likely artefacts produced by contam-
inating DNA-complexes. We find that density gradient
centrifugation can effectively separate EVs and DNA-
complexes, highlighting the importance of validating
elimination
of
contaminating
transfection
reagent
complexes when using transient transfection to inter-
rogate EV function.

Introduction: Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the most
deadly manlignancy, due to late daignosis and early
metastatic spread, which prohibits surgery. it is
urgently
for
relaible,
early
detection.
Research
shows that tumour-derived exosomes, which had
been present in the blood in the early stage of
tumour formation and before metastasis, is the van-
guard forces of tumour formation and metastasis;
Cancer stem cell-derived exosomes (CSC-Exos) has
stronger migration ability, so the detection of blood
CSC-Exos for early diagnosis and monitoring of pro-
gress for PaCa has great research potential and the
value of application.
Methods: Protein markers were selected according to
expression in exosomes of PaCa cell line culture
supernatants, but not healthy donors’ serum-exo-
somes. According to these preselections, serum-exo-
somes
were
tested
by
flow
cytometry
for
the
pancreatic cancer stem cell marker CD44v6 and
Tspan8.
Results: The majority (95%) of patients with PaCa
and patients with nonPa-malignancies reacted with
anti-CD44v6 and anti-Tspan8. Serum-exosomes of
healthy donors’ and patients with non-malignant
diseases were not reactive. Recovery was tumour
grading and staging independent including early
stages.
Summary/Conclusion: Thus, the evaluation of pan-
creatic CSC-derived exosomes awaits retrospective
analyses of larger cohorts, as it should allow for a
highly

Introduction:
Chronic
Traumatic
Encephalopathy
(CTE) is a tauopathy that affects individuals with a
history of mild repetitive brain injury frequently seen
in contact sports. Initial neuropathologic change of
CTE include perivascular deposition of phosphorylated
tau (p-tau) in cortical neurons and, in later stages, the
formation
of
neurofibrillary
tangles
in
neurons
throughout the brain. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are
known to carry neuropathogenic molecules in neuro-
degenerative disease and able to cross the blood brain
barrier. We therefore examined the protein composi-
tion of EV separated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and plasma in former national football League (NFL)
players
with
cognitive
dysfunction,
and
an
age-

sports.
Methods: EVs were separated from CSF and plasma
from former NFL players (n = 4, 14) and controls
(n = 5, 12) by affinity separation method or size exclu-
sion chromatography, respectively. The EV protein
profiling was characterized by SIMOA for tau and p-
tau and mass spectrometry. The protein data was ana-
lysed for EV enrichment, differentially expressed pro-
teins, pathway analysis and correlation with cognitive
function, head impact and tau/p-tau levels by biosta-
tistics and bioinformatics.
Results: The level of total tau and p-tau in CSF EVs
was not significantly changed, but significantly elevated
in plasma EVs from former NFL players. The 95 pro-
teins were commonly identified between the paired
plasma-CSF from the same patients, but there was no
significant correlation with disease status. Collagen

Density-based fractionation of urine to unravel the proteome landscape of
extracellular vesicles in prostate cancer

Structure and Repair, Ghent University, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute

Introduction: Current diagnostic tests are unable to
discriminate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer
(PCa), leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and
an intense interest in biomarkers to improve clinical
decision making. Urine is considered an ideal proximal
fluid for biomarker identification in PCa due to its
direct contact with the urogenital system. The discov-
ery and translation of extracellular vesicle (EV) content
into PCa biomarkers remains challenging due to the
difficulty of obtaining urinary EV (uEV) with high
specificity.
Methods: We developed a step-by-step protocol to
separate uEV by orthogonal implementation of ultra-
filtration and bottom-up density gradient centrifuga-
tion (BU-ODG). We implemented complementary
particle and protein measurements to identify uEV
(lower density) and protein rich fractions (higher den-
sity) and assess the performance of BU-ODG (specifi-
city,
efficiency
and
reproducibility).
Using
mass
spectrometry-based proteomics we interrogated uEV
and protein rich fractions from matched urine and
radical prostatectomy tissue samples from PCa patients
(n = 4), and urine from men with PCa prior to (n = 12)
and after local treatment (n = 10), benign prostatic
hyperplasia
(n
=
12)
and
other
urological
can-
cers (n = 11).
Results: BU-ODG separated uEV from soluble proteins
and Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP) complexes with
high specificity and reproducibility, outperforming dif-
ferential
ultracentrifugation,
ExoQuick
and
size-
exclusion chromatography. Comparison of the uEV
proteome from men with benign or malignant prostate
disease, allowed us to expand the known human uEV
proteome and identify a PCa specific uEV proteome
not uncovered by the analysis of the protein rich frac-
tion. Proteomic analysis of EV separated from prostate
tumour interstitial fluid and matched uEV confirmed
PCa specificity of the uEV proteome. Analysis of the
uEV proteome from patients with bladder and renal
cancer provided additional evidence of the selective
enrichment of protein signatures in uEV reflecting
their respective cancer tissues of origin.
Summary/Conclusion: We identified hundreds of pre-
viously undetected proteins in uEV of PCa patients and
developed a powerful toolbox to map uEV and protein
rich fractions, ultimately supporting biomarker discov-
ery for urological cancers.

Introduction: IgA is the most abundant antibody in
mucosal secretions and plays a crucial role in maintain-
ing the balance between the host and the gastrointestinal
microbiome. Recent studies suggested that pronounced
IgA coating is especially prominent among inflamma-
tory
commensals
which
drive
intestinal
disease.
Membrane vesicles (MVs, nano-sized particles released
by bacteria) have also been found to interact with the
host and modulate development and function of the
immune system. However, their interaction with IgA
has not been studied yet. Here we developed a method
to isolate and characterize the MVs from faecal samples
and checked for possible differences in IgA coating
patterns of MVs in health and disease.
Methods: MVs were isolated by using a combination of
ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography from
faecal samples of 6 healthy controls (HC), 6 patients
with active Crohn disease (CD) and 6 CD patients in a

remissive state. Quantification and verification have
been done with tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS-
based analysis) bead-based flow-cytometer (BBFC) and
transmission electron microscope (TEM). MVs were
selected with specific antibodies for capturing (Gram
+: LTA, Gram-: OmpA) followed by PE-conjugated
anti-human IgA antibodies as detection.
Results: We could successfully isolate 1*109-5*109
particles/ml from 500 mg of faeces. BBFC in combi-
nation with TRPS provide a valuable method for
(semi-)quantitative measurements of mixed popula-
tions.
Intriguingly,
remarkable
differences
were
found between IgA coating MVs derived from healthy
controls and active and remissive CD patients as MVs
derived from healthy controls were significantly more
coated compare to both CD patient groups. In details,
for selected G-ve derived MVs: 60% of the total
population of MVs derived from HC were coated,
20% from remissive CD patients, and <5% of active
CD patients; and for selected G+ ve derived MVs:
55% of the total population of MVs derived from
HC were coated, 34% from remissive CD patients,
and 25% of active CD patients. (Data are represented
as the mean).
Summary/Conclusion: Here we demonstrate for the
first time that MV isolated from the faecal samples
are also coated with IgA, and surprisingly MVs from
healthy volunteers were more densely coated than MVs
from diseased patients. The possible consequence of
this difference remains to be determined in future
studies.

Introduction: New diagnostic and therapeutic options
for patients with prostate cancer are urgently needed.
Prostate-specific
membrane
antigen
(PSMA)-based
imaging and therapy are increasingly used for prostate
cancer management. Unfortunately, as a membrane
protein, PSMA is not found as a soluble protein in
the blood and therefore has limited utility as a diag-
nostic biomarker. However, PSMA has reportedly been
observed as a cargo protein of prostate cancer-derived
extracellular vesicles (EVs).
Methods: We demonstrate altered PSMA expression
on EVs derived from prostate cancer cell cultures
(C4-2, LNCaP) in response to novel next-generation
androgen receptor inhibitor (enzalutamide), a standard
chemotherapy agent (docetaxel), a novel experimental
nonsteroidal antiandrogen (Epi-001) that binds cova-
lently to the N-terminal domain of the androgen recep-
tor and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Additionally, EVs
were isolated from the plasma of prostate cancer
patients who participated in the proCOC biobank cam-
paign at the USZ. Plasma was taken and stored from
patients both pre- and post- prostatectomy.
Results: Transmission electron microscopy, nanoparti-
cle tracking analysis and simple Western (WES) analy-
sis show stable size distribution and amount of EVs
produced by treated and non-treated cells. Using
advanced image-based flow cytometry, altered tatras-
panin and PSMA expression could be detected in EVs
isolated from cell culture supernatants of LNCaP and
C4-2 prostate cancer cells following their treatment.
Summary/Conclusion: Measuring PSMA expression
on extracellular vesicles might pave the way to use
image flow cytometry of EVs to develop a blood
based diagnostic test for prostate cancer patients with
a wide range of possible applications including: 1)
monitoring response to therapy and, 2) early indica-
tions of potential relapse.

Introduction: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a common
neurodegenerative brain disease which affects appro-
priately 30 million patients worldwide. One of the
major challenges in AD is to develop reliable biomar-
kers for early diagnosis and disease-modifying thera-
pies,
especially
before
the
clinical
symptoms.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry cargos of proteins,
lipids and nucleic acids. There was no comprehensive
characterization of EVs isolated from specific brain cell
types, which may be useful for cell type-specific bio-
markers. The purpose of this study is to isolate EVs

from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived brain cells for proteomic profiling and charac-
terization of cell type-specific molecules.
Methods: Human iPSCs-derived neurons, microglia
and primary cultured astrocytes were differentiated in
EV-depleted media. The EVs were isolated by differ-
ential centrifugation combined with size exclusion
chromatography, followed by characterization using
nanoparticle tracking analysis and mass spectrometry.
The proteomic data were subjected to bioinformatics
analysis
Results: We identified 153 proteins from neuron-
derived EV (NDE), 215 proteins from microglia-
derived EV (MDE) and 380 proteins from astrocyte-
derived EV (ADE) by proteomics. Gene ontology ana-
lysis indicated that most of these proteins are asso-
ciated
with
EVs.
Furthermore,
15,
48
and
251
proteins are present individually in NDEs, MDEs and
ADEs. Among them, high levels of ATP1A3 and SYT1
in NDEs, ITGAM and CD300A in MDEs, and EAAT1
and GFAP in ADEs were found, all of which are
typically and highly expressed in the original cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results provide us the
potential candidates for cell-type specific EV markers,
which will be helpful to develop non-invasive tools to
enrich EV originating from specific brain cells and may
lead to the development of new biomarkers for neuro-
degenerative disorders.

Introduction: The MISEV guidelines of 2018 (DOI:
10.1080/20013078.2018.1535750)
are
a
tremendous
resource for extracellular vesicle (EV) research, but
they are heavily focussed on mammalian EVs, i.e. EVs
from humans and laboratory animals, where protein
cargoes are well characterised, and a wide selection of
antibodies are commercially available. Protein markers
can be used to identify and define the types of mam-
malian EV and to determine the presence of any con-
taminants that might confound functional studies.
Similar resources are not as readily available for bacter-
ial EVs as these are not as well characterised, commer-
cially available antibodies are much less abundant and
immunological variation between different bacterial
species (and there are 1 trillion bacterial species on
planet Earth!) means that each species, strain, or
group
of
related
species
may
require
different
antibodies.
Methods: To identify quality markers for bacterial EVs,
we have characterised the proteome of cells, crude EVs
(ultracentrifuge pellet from cell free culture superna-
tant) and size exclusion chromatography or density
gradient centrifugation purified EVs from two different
(pathogenic vs probiotic) strains of Escherichia coli
grown under two different environmental conditions,
and one strain of Mycobacterium marinum grown in
one medium.
Results: Our results identify a selection of proteins
enriched in purified EV preparations, and proteins
that are depleted after purification steps.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results allow the identifi-
cation of potential markers for EV purity and non-EV
contaminants, but also highlight the variability in bac-
terial EV preparations and suggest potential targets that
can be used to investigate the heterogeneity of bacterial
EV populations.

blood may be potential biomarkers of age-related dis-
ease. EVs are nano-sized membranous vesicles that
bear molecular cargo and mediate intercellular com-
munication between different cells and tissues. Little is
known about whether EV characteristics differ by race
or whether EVs are associated with clinically relevant
mortality risk factors.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, plasma EVs
were isolated from middle-aged African American
(AA) and white males and females.
Results: We report no significant differences in EV size
or concentration with race or sex. There were signifi-
cantly higher EV levels of phospho-p53, total p53,
cleaved caspase 3, ERK1/2 and phospho-AKT in whites
compared to AAs. Higher EV levels of phospho-IGF-
1R were found in females compared to males. We
examined EV characteristics and protein cargo in the
context of well-established clinical mortality risk fac-
tors. EV concentration was significantly, and positively,
associated with several mortality markers including,
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), homoeo-
static model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-
IR), alkaline phosphatase, pulse pressure, body mass
index, and waist circumference. The relationship of
EV concentration and cargo with mortality markers
differs by race.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data show that EV-asso-
ciated proteins can differ by race and sex and are
associated with mortality risk factors. This study pro-
vides insight into the characterization of EVs in mid-
dle-aged AAs and whites, which may aid in the
development of EV-based diagnostics.

Introduction: Liquid biopsies offer a minimally inva-
sive approach to patient disease diagnosis and moni-
toring. However, many plasma processing protocols
have been designed with a single biomarker in mind.
Here we investigate whether specialised DNA blood
stabiliser tubes could be repurposed for the analysis
of extracellular vesicles (EVs).
Methods: Peripheral blood (n = 3) was collected into
K3-EDTA, Roche or Streck cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
blood collection tubes and processed using sequential
centrifugation immediately or after storage for 3 days.
MicroEV were collected from platelet poor plasma by
10,000 g centrifugation and NanoEVs isolated using
size exclusion chromatography. Particle size and counts
were assessed by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, pro-
tein by BCA assay and dot blotting for blood cell sur-
face proteins.
Results: Major variations in Micro and NanoEVs were
seen with delayed time to processing. NanoEV counts
did not change with processing delay or tube collection
type but the associated protein amount increased, indi-
cative of cell lysis or activation. The protein was pre-
dominantly derived from from platelets (CD61) and
red blood cells (CD235a). The increase in associated
protein was seen more in the K3-EDTA and Streck
tubes indicating that the Roche tubes may offer
improved
cell
stability.
Conversely,
MicroEVs
increased in both quantity and protein content with
delay to processing indicative of both lysis and cell
activation, irrespective of tube type. Epithelial cell sur-
face marker EpCAM abundance remained the same
across conditions in both Micro and NanoEVs demon-
strating that EpCAM+ EVs were stable.
Summary/Conclusion: Specialised cfDNA collection
tubes can be repurposed for Micro and NanoEV ana-
lysis, however simple counting or using protein quan-
tity as a surrogate of EV number may be confounded
by pre-analytical processing. The EVs would be suita-
ble for disease selective EV subtype analysis if the
molecular target of interest is not present in blood cells.

different alleles of HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1, to
investigate their involvement in coeliac disease (CD)
management.
Methods: A Chilean population (n = 30) was investi-
gated for SNPs mutations in HLA Class II alleles asso-
ciated to CD predisposition (as well as other mutations
related to other food intolerances), using the GenoChip
Food Technology. Exosomes have been isolated from
donors’ serum by ultracentrifugation and characterized
by SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting (CD63 and CD9), and
transmission electron microscopy. Exosomes were also
studied for their interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1ra) content.
Results: Among the studied population, 86% present at
least one of the alleles leading to CD development and
60% carry alleles encoding for α- and β-chains hetero-
dimers associated with very high risk to develop CD. In
parallel, isolated exosomes from donors with low to
extremely high risk for CD showed high IL-1ra content
(108.8 ± 15.91 to 148.8 ± 12.37), as the persons were
not following any treatment. However, values of IL-1ra
decrease in exosomes isolated form persons receiving
treatment for CD. A relationship between exosomes’
content and genetic susceptibility for CD has been
observed, which may suggest their possible use as bio-
markers for CD as the diagnostic of this disease is still a
big issue.
Summary/Conclusion: Until this point of this under-
way project, we demonstrate the existence of a relation-
ship between the exosomes’ content in IL-1ra and
genetic susceptibility for CD. Furthermore, the genetic
predisposition to CD could also modulate the gut colo-
nization process, another important player in intestinal
homoeostasis. In the next step, extracellular vesicles
from gut microbiota will be isolated and analysed to
determine their role in CD management.

Introduction: The ability to isolate extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) from blood is vital in the development of
EVs as disease biomarkers. Both serum and plasma can
be used but few studies have compared them in terms
of amount and type of EVs. We have previously devel-
oped a method to isolate EVs from plasma with mini-
mal contamination of lipoprotein particles (Karimi et
al 2018). The aim of this study was to compare the
presence of different subpopulations of EVs in plasma
and serum.
Methods: Blood was collected from healthy subjects,
from which plasma and serum were isolated. EVs were
isolated using a combination of density cushion and
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (protocol 1) or a
combination of density cushion and density gradient
(protocol 2) or immune-capturing (anti-CD63, anti-
CD9 and anti-CD81 beads) (protocol 3). Purity and
yield of EVs were determined by nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA), Western blot, electron microscopy
(EM), ExoView, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS).
Results: As determined by NTA and protein measure-
ment more EVs could be isolated from plasma with
protocol 1 and the majority of the vesicles were CD9/
CD41a positive as determined with ExoView and
Western
blot.
Additionally,
flow
cytometry
and
Western blot showed that more CD9/CD41a positive
EVs
where
also
identified
with
protocol
3.
Furthermore, Western blot showed increased amount
of CD41a in plasma samples in protocol 2. When
labelled EVs were spiked in freshly collected blood,
no difference in recovery was seen for plasma and
serum.
Summary/Conclusion: This study shows that a larger
amount of EVs could be isolated from plasma com-
pared to serum when three different isolation methods
were used. Firstly, this suggests that more EVs are
present in plasma. Secondly, it suggests that these vesi-
cles are probably released by platelets and that EVs are
not trapped in the clot during serum formation. Future
studies are needed to answer how this affects the use of
blood-derived EVs as biomarkers from serum and
plasma.

and homing to future metastatic niches. We have pre-
viously published an extensive proteomic profile of
secreted vesicles from the NCI-60 panel of human
cancer cells.
Methods: Here, we further examine the distinct integ-
rin components in these cancer-derived EVs, and addi-
tionally profile EVs released from benign epithelial
cells by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spec-
trometry for comparison.
Results: We demonstrate the enrichment of integrin
receptors in cancer EVs compared to vesicles secreted
from benign epithelial cells. Total EV integrin levels,
including the quantity of integrins α6, αv, and β1
correlate with tumour stage across a variety of epithe-
lial cancer cells. In particular, integrin α6 also largely
reflects breast and ovarian progenitor cell expression,
highlighting the utility of this integrin protein as a
potential circulating biomarker of certain primary
tumours. Other integrins including α4, αL, and β2 are
enriched in vesicles derived from leukaemia cells, and
may provide a means to distinguish haematopoietic
cell-derived EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: This study provides prelimin-
ary evidence of the value of vesicle-associated integrin
proteins in detecting the presence of cancer cells and
prediction of tumour stage. Differential expression and
selective packaging of integrins into EVs may contri-
bute to further understanding the development and
progression of tumour growth and metastasis across a
variety of cancer types.

Introduction: Tobacco products such as e-cigarettes
pose potential adverse health effects caused by direct
exposure to aerosolized nicotine, flavorants such as
menthol, and other particulates. Here, we aimed to
study
the
hypothesis
that
whether
nicotine
and
menthol modulate nicotine-metabolizing cytochrome
P450 2A6 (CYP2A6), antioxidant enzymes (AOEs),
SOD1 and catalase in plasma extracellular vesicles
(EVs). Modulation of these enzymes would eventually
lead to nicotine-induced toxicity and HIV-1 pathogen-
esis via EVs-based cell-cell interactions.
Methods: We isolated and characterized EVs from rat
plasma before and after nicotine self-administration
(NIC) with audiovisual cue (AV) and menthol and
characterized using EV markers according to the
ISEV guidelines. Protein associated with CYP2A6,
SOD1, and catalase were quantified by western blot.
Results: We measured size, total protein, and acetyl-
choline esterase activity of EVs and found no signifi-
cance difference in these characteristics before and
after NIC. To investigate the effect AV, menthol
alone or in combination in the absence and presence
of NIC, first we evaluated the expression of EV mar-
kers CD9 and CD63. The results showed menthol and
AV together increased the levels of CD9 (p ≤0.05), the
marker of small vesicles, in the presence of NIC. The
NIC with menthol and AV showed a pattern of
increased levels of small vesicle but could not reach
to significance. Next, we demonstrated that the NIC
with AV increased the level of SOD1 (p ≤0.05), which
showed a pattern of increased levels of catalase and
CYPA6,
though
statistically
non-significant.
The
expression of nicotine receptor did not change under
any conditions used. The results showed an increased
level of CYP2A6 (p ≤0.01), SOD1 (p ≤0.05), and
catalase (p ≤0.05) in plasma EVs in the menthol-NIC
group compared to menthol group only. NIC group
with a combined AV and menthol, showed further
increase in the levels of CYP2A6 (p ≤0.01), and cata-
lase (p ≤0.05). Further analysis of plasma EVs on
inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in these groups,
and the effect of plasma EVs on nicotine-induced toxi-
city and HIV pathogenesis are underway.
Summary/Conclusion: Nicotine administration increased,
though not statistically significant, the levels of circulatory
EVs. Moreover, the study provided evidence that nicotine
in the presence of menthol, AV, and/or menthol+AV
increased nicotine-metabolizing CYP2A6 in all the groups
and AOEs in specific groups.

Introduction: Biomarker discovery in breast cancer
(BC) is a clinical need for therapeutics and non-inva-
sive diagnostics. Tumour exosomes are involved in pre-
metastatic niche formation and drug resistance and
represent a source of non-invasive biomarkers. The
identification of tumour exosomal biomarkers pro-
vides, not only, the possibility to discriminate patient
groups also potential targets to control cancer progres-
sion that could be exploited to develop innovate BC
therapeutic strategies.
Methods: We have performed a comparative differenti.
al proteomic profile of four BC cell lines and their
derived- exosomes, representative of the most relevant
BC subtypes in clinic to search non-invasive biomarker
candidates. Then, we have carried on two bioinfor-
matics approaches: 1) protein association network ana-
lysis interaction (STRING) and 2) pathway inference
analysis (Hipathia), to characterize the functional pro-
filing for each BC subtype.
Results: We have found differentially-expressed pro-
teins, in both cells and exosomes, that include indica-
tors of invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and drug
resistance. Exosome proteome profile reflects their dif-
ferent BC cell origin suggesting potential indicators of
BC subtype. Further, bioinformatics analysis reveals a
differential role of exosomes in BC signalling pathways
in recipient cells, according to their protein cargo and
cell origin.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results show a set of cells
and exosome proteins that highly discriminate BC sub-
types and may significantly contribute to further stu-
dies for the design of BC biomarker predictor to
stratify BC patients and the development of novel
therapeutic strategies.
Funding: A set of potential biomarkers to discriminate
breast cancer subtypes.

Circulatory EVs as potential biomarkers of HIV-drug abuse interactions
and neurological dysfunction in HIV-Infected subjects and alcohol/
tobacco Users

Introduction: Abuse of alcohol and tobacco can
exacerbate HIV pathogenesis and its associated com-
plications. Further, the diagnosis of neurocognitive
disorders associated with HIV infection and drug
abuse using CSF or neuroimaging are invasive or
expensive methods, respectively. Therefore, extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs) can serve as reliable non-invasive
markers due to their bidirectional transport of cargo
from the brain to the systemic circulation. Hence, we
aimed to study the specific EVs proteins, which are
altered in both HIV and drug abusers to identify a
physiological marker to indicate the immune status
and
neuronal
dysfunction
of
HIV-positive
drug
abusers.
Methods: EVs were isolated from plasma of the follow-
ing subjects: a) Healthy b) HIV c) Alcohol drinkers d)
cigarette Smokers e) HIV+alcohol drinkers f) HIV
+cigarette smokers. Quantitative proteomic profiling
of EVs was performed by mass spectrometry and
potential EV proteins associated with neuronal dys-
function were quantified by westernblot.
Results: The EVs were characterized according to the
ISEV guidelines. A total of 343 proteins were detected
in EVs of all the study groups. Comparison of proteins
among all the study groups revealed that hemopexin
was significantly altered in HIV+drinkers compared to
drinkers and HIV subjects. Further, our study is the
first to show properdin expression in plasma EVs,
which was decreased in HIV+smokers and HIV+drin-
kers compared to HIV patients. Though we couldn’t
identify the few other CNS-specific proteins, G-FAP
and L1-CAM, associated with neuronal dysfunction in
plasma EVs by Mass spectrometry, we could detect
those
by westernblot.
The
protein
expression of
GFAP (p < 0.01) was significantly enhanced in plasma
EVs obtained from HIV-positive subjects and drinkers
compared to healthy subjects, suggesting enhanced
activation of astrocytes in those subjects. The L1CAM
expression was found to be significantly elevated in
smokers (p < 0.05). Both GFAP and L1CAM levels
were not further elevated in HIV+smokers compared
to HIV+nonsubstance users.
Summary/Conclusion: The present findings suggest
that hemopexin, and properdin show potential as mar-
kers for HIV-drug abuse interactions. Further, astro-
cytic
and
neuronal-specific
markers
(GFAP
and
L1CAM) can be packaged in EVs and circulate in
plasma, which is further elevated in the presence of
HIV infection, alcohol, and/or tobacco and thus may
represent as potential biomarkers for neurological dys-
function in those subjects.

Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, sin-
gle-stranded, non-coding RNA species that regulate
gene expression post-transcriptionally, and are trans-
ported by extracellular vesicles (EVs). They play an
essential role in biological processes, such as develop-
ment, cell proliferation, apoptosis, stress response and
tumorigenesis. Thus, miRNAs are considered relevant
biomarkers in health. More particularly, miRNA-21-
5p is expressed in neurons after traumatic brain
injury, being expectably transported to peripheral
fluids by brain EVs that cross the blood-brain barrier.
The main goal of this work is to develop an electro-
chemical biosensor for the detection of miRNA-21-5p
in serum.
Methods: Overall, the experimental assembly of the
biosensor was made in three stages. The first one con-
sisted in the electrodeposition of AuNPs, the second
one in the incubation of anti-miRNA21-5p on the
carbon screen-s printed electrodes and the final stage
in the incubation of mercaptosuccinic acid for blocking
unspecific bindings. The probe was hybridized with the
target miRNA21-5p by a consecutive incubation of
several standard solutions. Each modification was eval-
uated with cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave vol-
tammetry (SWV). The electrochemical behaviour of
the biosensor was followed in all steps by monitoring
the electron transfer features of a standard redox sys-
tem. The redox probe selected for this purpose was [Fe
(CN)6]4-/[Fe(CN)6]3-.
Results: The results indicated that the electrodeposi-
tion of gold was more effective for −1.5 V for 600 s and
could lead to better signals upon anti-miRNA-21-5p
hybridization.
Summary/Conclusion: In general, the experiments
showed increasing charged transfer resistance upon
the incubation of higher concentrations of miRNA-
21-5p.

Accurate EV concentration is critical for experimental rigour and
reproducibility

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are studied
for their potential as powerful therapeutics and bio-
markers of health and disease. Key to success in this
research are rigorous experiments to quantify the cargo
and biological activity of different vesicle preparations.
In these experiments, EV concentration is a critical
variable that must be carefully controlled to ensure
scientific rigour and reproducibility: Without control-
ling for concentration (dose), experimental outcomes
will exhibit excess variability that could mask impor-
tant biological discoveries.
In this study, three orthogonal methods are com-
pared for accuracy in EV quantification: Microfluidic
Resistive Pulse Sensing (MRPS) and Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis (NTA) were compared to each
other and relative to the gold standard method,
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The ability
of NTA to accurately measure particle concentration is
shown to depend on the polydispersity of the sample
itself. Results validate the accuracy of MRPS and
emphasize the importance of using orthogonal techni-
ques to quantify EVs.
Methods: Reference urinary vesicles were prepared and
analysed with the three methods and the relative con-
centration accuracy of NTA and MRPS were compared
as a function of particle size. The hypothesis that NTA
concentration accuracy was impeded by sample poly-
dispersity was tested using polystyrene bead mixtures
having a range of polydispersity. A theoretical argu-
ment based on fundamental physics explains the
experimental observations.
Results: TEM and MRPS measurements of the EVs
were in excellent agreement and showed a broad, poly-
disperse particle size distribution with no peak on the
measured size range (50 nm – 400 nm diameter). NTA
differed significantly from TEM and MRPS by report-
ing a steep decrease in measured concentration below
about 150 nm that resulted in a peak in the reported
particle size distribution. Bead measurements con-
firmed the hypothesis to be tested: Sample polydisper-
sity significantly affects the ability of the NTA method
to accurately measure concentration, even for particles
as large as 150 nm diameter.
Summary/Conclusion:
These
experiments
validate
MRPS as an accurate method for quantifying EVs and
highlight the importance of using orthogonal measure-
ment
methods
in
accordance
with
MISEV2018
guidelines.

Introduction: There is an unmet need to standardize
concentration measurements of extracellular vesicles
(EVs). Flow cytometry is the clinically most applicable
method, but the currently available reference materials
for calibration are insufficient. For example, the refrac-
tive index (RI) between standard particles and EVs
substantially differs, whereas concentration and fluor-
escence calibration particles are too bright. The goal of
this study is to ascertain the most desired properties of
reference materials to standardise EV measurements.

Methods: An online survey was prepared within the
MEVES II project to measure the desired size, concen-
tration range, optical properties, choice of fluoro-
chromes, and stability of synthetic EV reference
materials for flow cytometry (FCM) measurements.
Besides the desired properties of EV reference particles,
also the available instrumentation was assessed in the
survey, which was sent to the members of the
Stakeholder Committee of METVES II project and
members of the EV Flow Cytometry Working Group.
Results: The most desired size, concentration, and RI
range for EV reference particles is 50 nm to 500 nm,
10E7 to 10E10 1/mL, and 1.35–1.45, respectively. Based
on Mie-theory evaluation of the sensitivity of the avail-
able instruments, none of the respondents would be
able to detect 50 nm particles with RI = 1.35 with their
current instruments. Regarding fluorescence intensity,
the most desired range according to the responses is
from 10 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes
(MESF) to 10 000 MESF. Considering the sizes of EVs
and fluorescent labels, the maximal MESF that can be
obtained for EV reference particles with 50 nm dia-
meter and high molecular mass fluorescent dyes is in
the range of several hundreds. Typical antigen densities
on EVs fall below 100 copies per EV with 50 nm
diameter, i.e. MESF values above 100 are probably
not physiologically relevant in this size range.
Summary/Conclusion: A part of the desired properties
of EV reference materials precludes either their physi-
cal feasibility of production or their detection at most
currently available FCMs, meaning that the intended
reference materials will be future-proofed.

Introduction: EV clinical translation is limited by scale-
up of EVs production. Hollow fibre bioreactors (HFBR)
support culture of large numbers of cells at high densities.
Culture conditions may affect EV composition and
potency. Here we compare production, potency, identity
and therapeutic potential of EVs collected from cells
grown in culture dish (2D) versus HFBR (3D).
Methods: Human clonal AFSC were derived from
patient-consented
amniotic
fluids.
1x10e6
hAFSC
were seeded in 2D (145cm2), and 1.6X10e7 hAFSC
on a small 20kd MWCO HFBR (FiberCell-C2025D,
450cm2) with fibronectin coating; both cultured in
Chang medium with 20% of ES-FBS, starved for
24 hr and then EVs collected. The effect of harvest
frequency was tested (8hrs, 24 hr, 72hrs,1 wk). 2D-
EVs and 3D-EVs were compared by Nanosight,
potency assay (by WB), identity (by Exoview analysis)
and therapeutic effect (in vivo in an animal model of
kidney disease, Alport Syndrome).
Results: 2D production was ~5.5X10e9 EV/ml/24 hrs
while 3D was ~2.8X10e10 EV/ml (first four 24 hrs) and
~4.4X10e10 EV/ml (two days of hourly harvests). Very
little difference in EV concentration and very similar
size distribution (~130 nm) were observed during har-
vest intervals; possibly indicating either significant EV
re-uptake or inhibition of EV secretion dependent
upon free EV in the supernatant. 3D-EVs trapped
VEGF (an in vitro established potency assay) as effi-
ciently as 2D-EVs, and expressed CD9, CD81, CD63,
CD80, CD86 and VEGFR1 as 2D-EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: 3D-EVs had comparable prop-
erties and bio-activity to 2D-EVs, but the HFBR pro-
duced 10x more EVs. HFBR cell culture conditions for
hAFSC still need optimization, however an available
1.2 m2 cartridge provides a 50X scale up potential.
The HFBR, a cGMP closed system, can produce suffi-
cient numbers of EV to support pre-clinical and clin-
ical applications with at least similar properties to EVs
produced by conventional 2D methods.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mem-

vesicles, and apoptotic bodies. In recent years, the

key
mediators
of
intercellular

However, quantifying and characterizing EVs in a
reproducible and reliable manner is challenging due
to their small size – exosomes range from 30 to
100 nm in diameter. It is well-known that flow cyt-
ometers were originally designed to measure and detect
cells, and due to the quantitative power flow cytometry
offers, there has been a push to quantify and character-
ize EVs using flow cytometric methods. However, these
systems have not been designed to measure objects
smaller than a cell.
Methods: Here, we describe the use of High Gain mode
on the Amnis® ImageStream® Imaging Flow Cytometer to
address the challenges of measuring small particles. In
this new High Gain mode, the charge-coupled device
(CCD)-camera is manually adjusted to higher gain set-
tings, increasing the signal obtained from the EV. Object
thresholds and masking have also been adjusted to better
identify and detect small particles.
Results: Preliminary results using murine leukaemia
virus-sfGFP reference particles have shown up to a
fivefold increase in the number of GFP-positive objects
collected in High Gain mode, when compared to stan-
dard gain on the ImageStream System.
Summary/Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrate
improved small particle detection, including EVs, using
this new High Gain mode on the ImageStream Imaging
Flow Cytometer.

Introduction: Sensitive and simultaneous monitoring
of multiplexed exosome-associated RNAs is of great
value for early cancer diagnosis remains a challenge.
Methods: Here, we report a simple, multiple and sen-
sitive exosomes-associated multiplex miRNAs detec-
tion method that uses distance-controlled accelerated
catalysed hairpin DNA circuit (CHDC) system without
any complex operation or enzymatic amplification. The
distance-controlled accelerated CHDC can directly
enter the plasma exosomes to generate fluorescent
signal quantitatively by specifically targeting miRNAs
without any transfection means.
Results: We show that distance-controlled accelerated
CHDC strategy with signal amplification capability
could selectively and sensitively identify low level
RNAs in serum EVs, distinguishing patients with
early- and late-stage breast cancer from healthy donors
and patients with benign breast disease.
Summary/Conclusion: This simple, accurate, sensitive,
and cost-effective liquid biopsy by the distance-con-
trolled accelerated CHDC method is potent to be
developed as a non-invasive breast cancer diagnostic
assay for clinical applications.

Impact of isolation methods on biophysical heterogeneity of single extra-
cellular vesicles
Shivani Sharma
University of California Los Angeles, CA, Los Angeles, USA
Introduction: Current biophysical analysis of extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs) typically encompasses particle den-
sity and size distribution determinations using various
techniques. However, variabilities in EV isolation
methods and the structural complexity of these biolo-
gical-nanoparticles (sub-100 nm) necessitate more rig-
orous nanoscale biophysical characterization of single
EVs to facilitate more reliable and comparable EV-
based assays.
Methods: Combining atomic force microscopy (AFM),
super-resolution optical and conventional particle siz-
ing light scatter and microfluidic techniques, we com-
pared the unique sub-nanometre scale biophysical
properties of breast cancer cell-derived EV isolates
obtained using different isolation methods.
Results: AFM and dSTORM particle size distributions
showed coherent unimodal and bimodal particle size
populations in centrifugation and immune-affinity iso-
lates respectively. More importantly, AFM imaging
revealed striking differences in nanoscale morphology,
surface undulations, and vesicle-to-non-vesicle ratios
among EV isolates from different isolation methods.
Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of orthogonal
high-resolution biophysical characteristics of single EVs,
not discernable via particle size distributions and counts
alone.
Summary/Conclusion: The identified nanoscale bio-
physical characteristics of EV isolates represent a stra-
tegic
and
complementary

Introduction: Extracellular vesicle (EV) concentrations
measured by flow cytometry are incomparable. To
improve comparability, the METVES II consortium is
developing traceable reference materials and procedures,
which require validation by test samples. In previous
interlaboratory comparison studies, however, a main
source of variation was introduced by pre-analytical vari-
ables and measurement artefacts introduced by test sam-
ples. To minimize variation introduced by test samples,
our aim is to develop off-the-shelf biological test samples
containing pre-labelled EVs.
Methods: Human urine and plasma were collected
from healthy donors. EVs were labelled with lactad-
herin-FITC, isolated by size-exclusion chromatography
to remove free dye and minimize swarm detection, and
mixed with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), ExoCap or
trehalose, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°
C. After thawing, EV concentrations were measured by
a calibrated flow cytometer (Apogee A60-Micro).
Results: Compared to the EV concentrations measured
in
fresh
plasma
and
urine,
the
concentrations
decreased 27% in plasma (p = 0.04; mean of the 3
cryopreservation agents) and 35% in urine (p = 0.05)
after
one
day
of
storage.
After
5
months
of
cryopreservation, the concentration of plasma EVs
decreased 2% (DMSO and Exocap) and 8.5% (treha-
lose) compared to one day of storage, whereas the
concentration of urine EVs decreased 6% (Exocap)
and 18% (DMSO and trehalose).
Summary/Conclusion: We have developed ready-to-
use, pre-labelled human EVs that are stable up to
5 months and dedicated for use in interlaboratory
comparison
studies.
To
further
increase
stability,
other cryopreservation agents will be tested. Our bio-
logical test samples will be key to validate the new
reference
materials

Introduction: Despite much work performed on eval-
uating the potential effects of extracellular vesicles
(EVs), the functional uptake of their cargo is still con-
troversial. This project aimed to demonstrate that EV
content (protein and mRNA) is protected and can be
subsequently transferred with functional activity into
recipient cells, while also developing a tool to assess
and quantify functional EV uptake.
Methods: Fusion proteins used were mitochondrial
localized coxVIII-CFP-nanoluc(Cox) and nuclear loca-
lized H2B-RFP-nanoluc(H2B).
Results: HEK293 T cell-derived EVs protected Cox
proteins from proteinase K digestion while demon-
strating significantly improved efficiency of uptake
when compared to free protein, as measured by biolu-
minescence that was still detectable in recipient cells 96
hrs post-EV-exposure. To confirm functional uptake,
recipient cells exposed to EVs containing H2B for
72 hrs were imaged and some recipient cells manifested
fluorescent red nuclei. To demonstrate the presence of
functional mRNA within EVs, producer cells were
transfected for such a duration as not to have detect-
able levels of protein in the EVs while still containing
detectable levels of mRNA (qPCR) even after RNaseA
treatment. Transfer of these EVs to HeLa cells showed
an increase in expression of H2B which was blocked by

cyclohexamide, confirming translation of the mRNA
(2.2kb). To determine if recycling of EV delivered
proteins occurs, recipient HeLa cells were exposed to
EVs containing Cox for 72 hrs. All extracellular EVs
were removed and cells were trypsinized (0.25% for
30 min) to remove any non-internalized Cox protein.
48 hrs later, EVs (CD63+ and CD9+) released from
cells contained Cox suggesting recycling of protein or
possibly recycling of entire EVs. Lastly, an assay was
developed to measure functional EV uptake. Nanoluc
protein was split in two and fused to mTurquoise2
(N65) or mScarlet-I(66 C). Expression of each frag-
ment alone exhibited non-detectable levels of lumines-
cence while expressing both together had a significantly
increased signal. Delivery of either fragment within an
EV to a cell expressing the corresponding fragment
worked as confirmation and quantification of EV
uptake (HEK293, U87, HeLa cells).
Summary/Conclusion: This study robustly demon-
strates EV delivery of functional mRNA and protein
to cells, while also establishing a simple assay to quan-
tify and validate functional EV uptake.

Introduction: Short-term storage of unfrozen samples
of vesicles, mainly at 4°C, overnight or during a couple
of
days
is
rather
common
laboratory
practice.
However, it was found to lead to significant losses of
vesicle concentration supposedly due to adsorption on
the walls of the tube. The present work develops a
theoretical model intended to describe the vesicle
adsorption process. The experimental validation of
the model was made using method of immunomag-
netic precipitation.
Methods: The theoretical model considers the “diffu-
sion-limited” case of vesicles storage. The maximal
adsorption capacity of the surface of contact between
the tube and the solution is given as the number of
vesicles in hexagonally packed monolayer.
For experiment, the vesicles were purified from
HT29 cell culture supernatant by differential centrifu-
gation, aliquoted and kept at −80 C. Further the ali-
quots were consequently unfrozen, and placed into the
tubes with different surface treatment and kept at +4 C.
The kinetics of vesicles loss was measured by anti CD9
immunomagnetic capturing followed by CD81, EpCam
and CD166 staining and flow cytometry.
Results: The model allows the estimation of the
adsorption-associated losses as dependent on initial
vesicles concentration, volume of the solution, tube
geometry, the storage temperature and duration case
of quiet vesicles storage (without mixing) and also
accounts an expected effect of active agitation of the
solution (EV-beads complexes formation).
Theoretical calculations were illustrated by analysis of
EV at different storage conditions and during reaction of
immunomagnetic precipitation of the vesicles.
Summary/Conclusion: It was demonstrated that appli-
cation of tubes surface treatment allows increasing
sensitivity of immunomagnetic precipitation method
to 2x10^5 for CD81+, 5x10^5 for EpCam+ and
2x10^8 for CD166+ vesicles.

Introduction: It is now largely accepted that the intestinal
microbiota plays a key role in Intestinal Bowel Diseases
(IBD). An imbalance in the composition and diversity of
the intestinal microbiota (i.e. dysbiosis) of patients has
been repeatedly pointed out by several teams. There are
also indications that extracellular vesicles produced by
bacteria and exosomes produced by epithelial cells
might be increased in this family of diseases.
Methods: In order to differentiate healthy and IBD
faecal samples on the basis of their vesicle profiles, we
want to develop a means to enumerate rapidly particles
in faecal samples, based on interferometric microscopy.
The Videodrop technology, developed by Myriade,
relies on the creation of single beam interferences
between two signals from the same light path by nano-
particles such as small vesicles. It will permit to com-
pare on large scales the viral load of healthy subjects
and IBD patients.

Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) pro-
duced by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-sEVs) may
be useful in cell-free therapies for immunomodulation
and tissue regeneration.
Methods: To characterize MSC-sEVs produced ex vivo,
human
bone
marrow
MSCs
were
cultured
in
MesenCult-ACF Plus (MACFP), an EV-free and ani-
mal component-free culture medium for 3 days and
spent medium collected to isolate sEVs by ultracentri-
fugation (UC). Analyses of sEVs were performed by
Nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA), western blot
(WB), and human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(HUVEC) tube formation assay.
Results: Analysis of fresh uncultured MACFP by UC,
NTA and WB for CD63, CD81, and CD9 confirmed
the absence of sEVs. MSC-sEVs isolated from spent
MACFP by UC ranged from 80–150 nm in size and
were positive for CD63, CD9, and CD81 proteins.
These sEVs could be stored at −80°C for >4 months
in solution or lyophilized with minimal loss based on
NTA and WB analysis. The MSC-sEVs contained the
MSC-associated microRNAs let7a, miR21, and miR26a
as per qPCR analysis. The biological function of ex vivo
isolated MSC-sEVs was assessed using a human umbi-
lical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation
assay. HUVECs treated with MSC-sEVs generated
tubes as early as 6 h after seeding, which were not
observed in control HUVEC cultures until 15 h.
Moreover, the number of branch points present in
such tube structures was >fourfold higher in HUVEC
cultures (n = 5) supplemented with MSC-sEVs versus
control, with the former lasting >60 h and the latter
lasting <50 h in culture. Direct comparison of the
performance of MACFP medium to media containing
non-depleted or EV-depleted foetal bovine serum
demonstrated that only MSCs cultured in MACFP
(n = 3) were able to expand robustly with a doubling
time of 1.1, 2.1 and 8.9 days in these media, respec-
tively. Lastly, methods for isolating sEVs using newly
developed EasySep-EV™magnetic separation kits and
size exclusion columns will be presented.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, these data
demonstrate that MSC-sEVs can be produced in high
yield in MACFP medium and that these possess similar
physical, phenotypic and functional characteristics as
sEVs in vivo.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are hetero-
geneous group of small vesicular structures released by
different types of cells, including stem cells (SCs). As
recent studies demonstrate that they may enclose
bioactive content and transfer it into the target cells,
growing interest is placed on the utilization of EVs in
the field of biomedical research. However, there is still
lack of standardized methods of EVs characterization.
As an example, typical flow cytometry-based protocols,
commonly used for cells phenotyping, may be inade-
quate for the characterization of EVs as particles with
size close to the detection limit of conventional

cytometers. Thus, the aim of this study was to optimize
and compare the use of different flow cytometry plat-
forms for the multiparameter analysis of EVs isolated
from different types of SCs populations.
Methods: EV samples were obtained by ultracentrifu-
gation of conditioned media collected from selected
SCs types, including human induced pluripotent SCs
(iPS) and mesenchymal SCs (MSCs). Next, several high
resolution flow cytometry systems: Cytoflex, Apogee
(A50 and A60 Micro-Plus) and Image Stream Mk II
were employed to compare their sensitivity and resolu-
tion,
as
well
as
influence
of
“swarm”
effect.
Furthermore, we examined EVs phenotype, including
expression of tetraspanins and other surface markers.
Results: Our results have revealed that tested flow
cytometry systems may be utilized for the phenotypic
characterization of EVs secreted by SCs populations.
However, the conventional staining and gating strategy
protocols
have
to
be
thoroughly
optimized.
Additionally, depending on a type of tested cytometer,
we have demonstrated the difference in a “swarm”
effect and its influence on obtained results regarding
EVs phenotype. Finally, imaging flow cytometry plat-
form was also employed to visualize EVs on the single
particle level.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, we have demon-
strated that tested high-resolution flow cytometry plat-
forms are convenient methods for the multiparameter
characterization of EVs produced by different types of
SCs populations. However, careful selection of particu-
lar measurement parameters should be performed
depending on a type of employed system.

Introduction: Exosomes are subcellular particles 30–
150 nm in size released from cells through a fusion of
multicellular
bodies
with
the
plasma
membrane.
Exosomes are stable carriers of cell-free cargo in the
form of DNA, RNA, and proteins, thereby making
them an attractive candidate for diagnostic and ther-
apeutic applications. However, isolating a consistent
population of exosomes can be challenging and there
is an unmet need for highly characterized exosomes for
use as reference standards in extracellular vesicle
research (EV).
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from cell culture
supernatants of different ATCC cell lines including
stem cells and cancer cell lines representing the most
prevalent cancer types -prostate, colorectal, breast,
lung, cervical and glioblastoma, using Tangential flow
filtration (TFF). These exosomes underwent sterility
and mycoplasma tests as a part of their quality control.
The morphology and size distribution of these exo-
somes were evaluated through multiple strategies
including
Nanoparticle
tracking
analysis
(NTA),
Asymmetrical
flow
field-flow
fractionation
(AF4),
Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and Spectra
DyneTM particle analyser. Exosome surface markers
were also analysed through multiple strategies such as
electro chemiluminescent ELISA, flow cytometry and
western blotting. Also, stem cell exosomes and cancer
exosomes were further evaluated for functionality
through in vitro functional assays including migration
assay, angiogenesis and anchorage independent growth
assay.
Results: Our optimized TFF method resulted in high
yields of > 1 × 1010 exosomes/mL and average protein
equivalent of more than 1 mg/mL. More than 90% of
the exosomes population had an average size distribu-
tion of 50–200 nm and median size of 110 nm con-
firmed through a number of different size distribution
instruments. Although cell line dependent, we were
able to obtain similar expression levels of different cell
surface markers including tetraspanins (CD63, CD81,
CD9) when evaluated through different methods. Our
functional data demonstrated stem cell exosomes were
functionally active in promoting cell migration and
tubule formation. Additionally, cancer cell exosomes
were found to promote a malignant phenotype in an
anchorage independent growth assay.
Summary/Conclusion:
Collectively,
we
demon-
strated our ability to reproducibly manufacture pro-
duction-scale batches of exosomes from multiple
different cell types. Our purified exosomes are of
high yield, meet well-established quality control spe-
cifications, and are robust in maintaining size dis-
tribution,
surface
marker
expression,
and
functionality in vitro. Therefore, they can serve as
ideal reference materials that can support different
EV-based research applications.

Introduction: Physical activity brings about a wide-
spread physiological response and elicits the beneficial
adaptation of several tissues and organs. Furthermore,
regular participation in physical activity reduces the
risk of developing major non-communicable diseases
such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, osteo-
porosis,
and
dementia.
Two
important
processes
known to occur following physical activity are myogen-
esis and neurogenesis; both of which involve the acti-
vation and proliferation of specialised tissue-resident
stem cells. The molecular mechanisms regulating these
processes following exercise are poorly understood to
date. Here, we investigated the contribution of extra-
cellular vesicles, which are released into the circulation
after
exercise,
to
benefit
adult
myogenesis
and
neurogenesis.
Methods: Small extracellular vesicles were enriched
from the blood of healthy participants before and fol-
lowing maximum and moderate intensity exercise.
Differentiation and proliferation using a range of
methods was measured following vesicle treatment
onto primary myoblasts and neuronal primary ex-
vivo stem cells. Activation of key cellular pathways
were measured.
Results: We show significant proliferation and differ-
entiation changes of both stem cell types. This is inde-
pendent of extraction method, extracellular vesicle
depleted fractions and is interestingly conserved across
mammalian species. Remarkably, we see an age-related
effect.
Summary/Conclusion: This advocates that short single
bouts of exercise may promote myogenesis and neuro-
genesis via systemic signalling of extracellular vesicles
which opens an interesting field in endogenous EV
therapies.

Introduction: Clinical-grade induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial cells (hiPSC-
RPE) show promise as a cell-based therapy for retinal
degeneration. While clinical trials are ongoing, the
potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers
for monitoring eye health and disease is not well stu-
died. This study characterized the EV surface profile
and cargo of hiPSC-RPE to offer a baseline assessment
in normal and disease conditions. Moreover, we eval-
uated the importance of PNPLA6, a gene involved in
membrane integrity and when mutated causes retinal
degeneration, in EV biogenesis and secretion.
Methods: EVs were isolated from serum-free culture
medium of hiPS-RPE and identified with nanoparticle
tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy,
and immunoblot analysis of exosomal markers, includ-
ing Alix, TSG101, and CD63. Surface marker detection
and proteomic profiling were completed using an EV
surface marker kit and mass spectrometry, respectively.
Small interfering RNA targeting PNPLA6 was used to
knockdown the expression in hiPSC-RPE and EVs
were characterized.
Results: Nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed the
presence of both microvesicles (>150 nm) and exo-
somes (<150 nm) by size distribution and the concen-
tration of EVs (1x108 particles/ml) from RPE. TEM
displayed typical morphological characteristics of EVs.
The presence of known EV markers, Alix, TSG101, and
CD63 was confirmed via immunoblot and flow cyto-
metry. Surveillance of EV surface markers revealed
enrichment of epithelial markers (CD326) and stem
cell markers (CD133/1) that depict donor cell origin
and functional proteins including integrin-binding
(CD29) and TGF-beta receptors (CD105). In addition,
proteomic analysis revealed regulators of inflammation
and RPE function, including hemopexin, clusterin,
complement factor I, and pigment epithelium-derived
factor. Furthermore, reduction in PNPLA6 expression
reduced vesicle secretion and vesicle size compared to
non-targeting controls.
Summary/Conclusion: HiPSC-RPE expresses a popu-
lation of EVs reflective of normal RPE function. The
knockdown of PNPLA6 negatively impacts vesicle
secretion and suggests a role for EVs in retinal health.
Future studies will elucidate the role of EVs in retinal
maintenance and disease states.

Introduction:
Vascular
endothelial
growth
factor
(VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor and was first
described as an essential growth factor for vascular
endothelial cells. VEGF plays a role in normal physiolo-
gical functions such as bone formation, haematopoiesis,
wound healing, and development. Mesenchymal stem
cell (MSC) was found to secretes potential growth factors
such as VEGF when cultured in vitro. However there are
some beliefs that Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) which
usually used as serum in cell culture content VEGF.
Methods: MSC seeded in in 96-well plate in with con-
centration of 5,000 cell/well. Cells were incubated for
24 hours and fasted for another 16 hours using only
DMEM. Cells were treated with complete medium
consist of DMEM and 10% FBS. Culture medium
were collected after 5, 12, and 24 hours after treatment.
Cell were culture in 37ºC dan 5% CO2. VEGF concen-
tration was detected using ELISA technique.
Results: VEGF concentration was not found in FBS
which do not contact with MSC. An increasing of
VEGF concentration in time-dependent manner was
shown when culture medium was used in MSC cell
culture in normoxic condition. The result of VEGF
concentration when culture 5, 12, and 24 hours were
74.022 pg/mL, 76.67 pg/mL, and 93.58 pg/mL, respec-
tively. The mechanism of MSC release growth factor is
still under investigated. However, the Classic growth
factors and cytokines serves paracrine control mole-
cules which were important in regenerative medicine.
VEGF was found to be an important molecules in
angiogenesis process and determine the fate of cells.
Summary/Conclusion: MSC secreted VEGF and con-
centration increased in time-dependent manner.

Introduction: Unlike induceddiseasemodelsusinglabora-
tory animals, naturally occurring disease models display
pathophysiologic attributes that are more similar to human
diseases. Unfortunately these models are underutilized in
translational regenerative medicine research. This is partly
due to the slow development of species-specific experimen-
tal therapeutics to investigate comparative efficacy. Thus,
we set out to isolate and characterize exosomes from canine
adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cAD-MSC) to
use as a comparative therapeutic in dogs. To accomplish
this, we optimized an isolation and purification strategy
and characterized their molecular properties.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated by sequential centri-
fugation and subsequent ultrafiltration. The proteome
was characterized by tandem mass tag (TMT) mass
spectrometry and the miRNA cargo was identified
using a canine specific PCR array with subsequent
target and enrichment analysis using TargetScan and
the Panther platform, respectively. Also, nanoparticle
tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy
were used to determine exosome size and structure. To
investigate bioactivity, we measured the ability of exo-
somes to inhibit collagen production in an in vitro
model of fibrosis.
Results: Exosomes were purified by ultrafiltration
using a 100 KDa cut-off. Proteomic analysis by TMT
mass spectrometry identified 1262 unique proteins.
90% of the ExoCarta top 100 were identified from
this list. Additionally, we identified the miRNA cargo
within exosomes and found 27 highly expressed
miRNAs. Enrichment analysis identified multiple path-
ways of probable regulation including angiogenesis
(Fold Enrichment = 3.1; p < 0.0001) and transforming
growth
factor-beta
(TGFb)
signalling
(Fold
Enrichment = 4.1; p < 0.0001). Exosome size was
quantified to be 119.7 ± 3.4 nm with a modal average
of 98 nm. Lastly, in the presence of exosomes, TGFb
stimulated fibroblasts deposited 32.2% less collagen
than vehicle controls (p = 0.036).
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, cAD-MSCs exo-
somes display structural and functional features com-
parable to stem cell derived exosomes from other
species. Use of these exosomes in naturally occurring
disease canine models may provide superior predictive
value for human clinical trials.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are
multipotent stromal cells and have been described
as key regulators of different aspects of tumour phy-
siology. In tumour pathogenesis, MSCs can integrate
the tumour microenvironment after recruitment and
are able to interact with cancer cells to promote
tumour
modifications
by
affecting
epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT). It was revealed that
exosomes derived from MSCs are critical players in
the tumour niche. Exosomes are a novel way of cell-
to-cell communication and play crucial roles in the
majority of pathways that contribute and affect
response to therapy, cell-adhesion molecules and
the progression of tumour cells. Because of the
known
importance
of
this
communication
we
decided to investigate the implication of MSCs with
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines as well
as
exosomal
profiles
between
the
experimental
conditions.
Methods: The interactions of MSCs with triple negative
breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) was
performed by coculturing MSCs (or TNBC cell lines) with
exosomes derived from TNBC cell lines (or MSCs).
Physical characterization of isolated exosomes was per-
formed followed by their molecular investigations. Cell
proliferation was detected by MTT assay and migration
was analysed by wound healing assay using 2D cultures.
Moreover, we also used 3D culture to assess the exosomes
uptake and to observe their capability of internalization
into a 3D structure. The alterations in expression level of
some transcripts (mRNAs and miRNAs) and protein pro-
file were investigated by qRT-PCR, western blot and
immunofluorescence staining.
Results: We found that MSCs-derived exosomes are
actively incorporated by triple negative breast cancer
cell lines (2D culture). In coculture, in TNBC cells the
expression level of mesenchymal markers and EMT
markers (E-cadherin, vimentin) at mRNA and at pro-
tein levels, as well as miRNA-derived exosomes target-
ing mesenchymal genes were significantly affected.
Using bioinformatics tools, we highlighted the impor-
tant biological processes which were activated by pro-
moting tumour modifications. In addition, using 3D
culture we provided a comprehensive understanding
regarding exosomes internalization in 3D structures,
which closely mimics in vivo conditions, compared to
2D culture.
Summary/Conclusion: In this work, we focus on the
investigation of MSCs-derived exosomes in order to
highlight their implication in several biological processes,
including tumour proliferation and progression of triple
negative breast cancer cells. All these alterations affect the
response to therapy and should be considered for develop-
ing efficient therapeutic strategies.

Natural killer cell-derived extracellular vesicles have a potent anti-leukae-
mic effect and selectively target the cancer stem cell subpopulation

Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, USA
Introduction: Natural killer (NK) cells of the immune
system recognize and kill tumour cells. Extracellular
vesicles (EVs) secreted from NK cells are capable of
killing tumour cells independent of the cell to cell
contact required for NK cell activation. Cancer is a
leading cause of death, primarily due to metastasis
and recurrence.
Cancer stem cells
(CSC) within
tumours are resistant to chemotherapy and immune
attack, and cause metastasis and relapse. Identification
of the cancer types killed by NK EVs is limited, and the
effect of NK EVs on CSCs has not been described. Here
we determine whether NK-derived EVs kill a myeloid
leukaemia cell line and its CSC subpopulation.
Methods: NK EVs were isolated from our NK cell line,
NK3.3, derived from normal human lymphocytes.
NK3.3 EVs were characterized by immunoblotting,
proteomics, and next generation RNA sequencing.
Human K562 leukaemia cells were treated with NK3.3
EVs in vitro and analysed for proliferation and markers
of cell death.
Results: NK3.3 EVs contain EV-associated proteins
Alix, CD63, HSP70, and Tsg101, NK effector molecules
perforin, granzymes A and B, granulysin and NKLAM/
RNF19b, an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for maximal
NK cytotoxicity, and tumour suppressor miR-186.
NK3.3 EV treatment of K562 significantly decreased
its expression of proliferation markers CD71 and Ki67,
and increased the frequency of apoptotic and necrotic
cells, paralleled by elevated levels of active caspases −3
and −7. Non-tumorigenic cells were unaffected by NK
EV treatment. Most notably, NK3.3 EV treatment sig-
nificantly reduced the frequency of K562 cells highly
expressing ALDH, a CSC marker.
Summary/Conclusion: NK3.3-derived EVs have a
robust anti-tumour effect on K562 myeloid leukaemia
cells and selectively target the CSC population, suggest-
ing they may circumvent the evasion and resistance

Scalable manufacturing system for MSC-EV generation

Introduction: Due to their potential as a key bioactive
agent in regenerative medicine applications, MSC-
derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are increas-
ingly
being
investigated
as
a
clinical
therapy.
Manufacturing that generates enough EVs for product
development and clinical doses is currently a limitation
in the field and clearly a scalable manufacturing solu-
tion
will
be
necessary
for
successful
translation.
Moreover, a complementary approach that increases
the EV productivity, i.e. the number of EVs produced
per cell, could further help to accelerate the develop-
ment of MSC-EVs as a therapy.
Methods: We developed a process that leverages a
series of new cell culture reagents to couple to our
established cell-media system for scalable manufactur-
ing of MSC-EVs. Briefly, human bone marrow- or
umbilical cord-derived MSCs were rapidly expanded
under xeno-free conditions (i.e. >150X expansion
within 10 days). Cultures were then switched to our
proprietary EV collection medium and EVs were har-
vested for up to three additional days. At the end of
culture, the EVs in the conditioned media were con-
centrated using a tangential flow filtration (TFF) sys-
tem. To increase the productivity of MSCs, two
medium supplements were developed that increased
EV yield by either increasing the number of EVs gen-
erated per cell in a shortened culture process or
increasing the number of collected EVs by lengthening
the EV collection culture period.
Results: This scalable MSC-EV manufacturing method
was implemented in both 2D flask and 3D bioreactor
culture and generated over 2,000 particles per cell in
2D and over 4,000 particles per cell in 3D. With the
addition of a medium supplement to increase EVs
produced per cell, the EV productivity was increased
>2x after 24 hrs. Alternatively, EV productivity was
also increased >2x by addition of the medium supple-
ment that extended EV collection culture period.
Summary/Conclusion: MSC-EV success in clinical
translation will be reliant on a manufacturing method
that can scalably and reliably generate large amounts of
EVs.
These
results
present
one
such
solution.
Furthermore, increasing EV productivity, for instance
by medium supplements that increase EVs per cell or
lengthen culture times could further address the limita-
tion of generating the EVs required for development
and translation of clinical therapies.

Simplifying scalable MSC EV production in a microcarrier-based bioreac-
tor system

Introduction: The growpt0ing numbers of MSC-EV
clinical applications drives the need for a scalable
MSC-EV production platform. While most MSC-
EVs are generated while cells are attached to tissue
culture plastic, such 2D cultures cannot be scaled up
to meet the yields necessary for commercialization of
EV-based therapeutics. We have shown that 3D bior-
eactors can be used to generate MSC-EVs and that
paradigm can be scaled directly in terms of yield from
the 3 to 15 L scales. The technical expertise of seeding
cells onto microcarriers for expansion in bioreactors,
however, requires technical expertise not available to
all those in the EV field. Therefore, our goal here is to
simplify and expedite the EV collection process in
bioreactors by cryopreserving cells on microcarriers,
such that end users can merely thaw and then collect
MSC-EVs.
Methods: MSCs were expanded in 2D and then seeded
on three different microcarriers and cultured in a bior-
eactor for 5 days. When confluent, cells on microcar-
riers were cryopreserved. To evaluate the microcarriers
and the cryopreservation protocol, the cells-microcar-
riers were thawed, cultured in a bioreactor in growth
media for 24 hours, then in EV collection media for 3
additional days. Cell recovery and EV production upon
thaw was evaluated and compared to EV collection
from fresh, non-cryopreserved cells.

Results: Total cell counts 24 hrs post thaw were com-
parable to those before cryopreservation and to fresh
samples prior to EV collection. Following 3-day EV
collection, concentration of particles collected from
cryopreserved cells on microcarriers were similar to
those collected from the fresh cells (2E9 particles/ml).
This process was validated for two different microcar-
riers using two separate cryopreservation solutions.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results show that cryopre-
served hMSCs on microcarriers can support EV collec-
tion in a 3D bioreactor process with a particle yield
that is comparable to those collected from fresh cells.
This cryopreserved product can simplify EV produc-
tion, reducing cost and time by removing process steps
associated with the hMSC expansion, with in a para-
digm suitable for scale-up.

Introduction: Skeletal muscle-derived stem cells pos-
sess potent therapeutic activities in the treatment of
muscle-related disorders. In our study, we tried to
isolate
and
characterize
orbicularis
oculi
muscle
(ORM)-derived stem cells (ORM-SCs) from the dis-
carded human tissues which were obtained from the
ocular surgery-subjected patients. We also prepared the
natural extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the cultured
ORM-SCs and assessed the their therapeutic actitities
including the skin whitening, anti-wrinkle, and wound
healing effects.
Methods: We isolated the ORM-SCs from the patients
subjected to ocular surgery and characterized the
ORM-SCs by analysing cell morphology, proliferation,
expression levels of the cell surface and stemness-asso-
ciated markers, and tri-lineage differentiation and col-
ony-forming
capacities,
confirming
the
stemness
properties of the ORM-SCs. Then, we prepared the
natural EVs from the ORM-SCs via the centrifugation
and filtration of the media supernatants and their ther-
apeutic activity was investigated.
Results: The isolated ORM-SCs showed spindle-like
morphology and positive expression of CD105, CD
90, and CD73, but they were negative in expression
of CD45 and CD34. The ORM-SCs showed the capa-
city of osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic dif-
ferentiations. The EVs from ORM-SCs (ORM-SC-EVs)
possessed the apparent inhibitory effect on the melanin
synthesis in B16F10 cells by blocking the tyrosinase
activity, although ORM-SC-EVs treatment did not dra-
matically change the expression level of melanogenesis-
related genes, such as microphthalmia-associated tran-
scription factors (MITF), tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-
related protein1(TYRP-1), and TYRP-2. In addition,
we confirmed that ORM-SC-EVs could stimulate skin
cell migration and increase the expression level of anti-
wrinkle related genes and wound-healing properties.
Summary/Conclusion: This study revealed the stem
cell property of ORM-SCs and the whitening, anti-
wrinkle, and wound healing effects of ORM-SC-EVs,
suggesting that ORM-SCs and ORM-SC-EVs can be
successfully used for stem cell-based EV therapy and
cosmetics, by regulation the melanogenesis, wrinkle,
and wound.

Introduction: Neurological diseases and disorders are
leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Many
of these pathologies are associated with high levels of
neuroinflammation and irreparable tissue damage. We
have previously shown that extracellular vesicles (EVs)
from infected cells contain viral by products (non-
coding RNAs and proteins) and that these EVs can
exert
deleterious
effects
on
recipient
cells1-3.
Therefore, in the context of neurotrophic viruses EVs
may contribute to or perpetuate processes relating to
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Due to
their multipotent properties, stem cells have broad
applications for tissue repair; additionally, stem cells
have been shown to possess both immunomodulatory
and neuroprotective properties. In recent years it has
been well-established that stem cell EVs play a critical

role in the functionality associated with stem cells. The
diverse biological cargo contained within these vesicles
are proposed to mediate their effects and, to date, the
reparative and regenerative effects of stem cell EVs
have been demonstrated in a wide range of cell types.
While a high potential for their therapeutic use exists,
there is a gap of knowledge surrounding their charac-
terization, mechanisms of action, and how they may
regulate cells of the central nervous system (CNS).
Methods: We have isolated and recovered high yields
of EVs from large scale cultures of both induced plur-
ipotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) using tangential flow filtration. Our EV char-
acterization includes both phenotypic (size, tetraspanin
expression) and biochemical assays. EV functionality
has also been assessed in vitro utilizing several cell-
based assays related to cellular viability, migration,
angiogenesis, and immunomodulation in both healthy
and damaged recipient cells with relevance to the CNS.
Results: Our data suggests that EVs from different
sources of stem cells display unique phenotypes, exhi-
bit differential association with various cytokines, pro-
teins, and long non-coding RNAs, and have the ability
to significantly enhance processes that are critical for
cellular repair4. Lastly, utilizing an iPSC-derived neu-
rosphere model, we have observed a robust uptake of
stem cell EVs and have found that these EVs are able to
effectively penetrate these 3D structures.
Summary/Conclusion: Collectively, these results high-
light the “holistic” properties of stem cell EVs by
demonstrating their ability to partially reverse or
reduce damage in various cell types.

Introduction: Cell culture media and its supplements
are known to affect the secretion and isolation of
extracellular
vesicles
(EVs)
from
cell
cultures.
Identification of these effects is crucial especially
when planning to use EVs as therapeutic agents.
Here, we investigated the effect of cell culture media
on EV yield from human mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-
derived neurons.
Methods: EVs were collected from cell-conditioned
media (CCM) and no cell control (NCC) media using
size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). MSCs were cul-
tured in DMEM/F12:neurobasal medium or in Opti-
MEM reduced serum medium, both supplemented
with exosome-depleted foetal bovine serum (FBS).
The EV yield from hPSC-derived neurons was com-
pared at two maturation time points (day 46 and 60),
in DMEM/F12:neurobasal or in Opti-MEM, with and
without 3-hour KCl stimulation. SEC fractions were
analysed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), pro-
tein concentration assay and blinded transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM).
Results: CCM samples had a clear peak of EVs in SEC
fractions 7–10, which was not detected with NCC.
Interestingly, a second population of EVs eluted in
SEC fractions 13–17 in both CCM and NCC, indicating
presence of EVs in exosome-depleted FBS. Moreover,
this second population differed largely between used
media batches. Culture medium had no significant
effect on MSC EV yield (DMEM: 8.30E+08 particles/
ml, Opti-MEM: 9.61E+08 particles/ml). With neuronal
cultures, no significant differences in EV yield were
found between culture media or cell maturation time
points. In contrast to earlier findings, 3-hour stimula-
tion of neurons by KCl resulted in significantly smaller
EV yield compared to non-stimulated controls (stimu-
lated: 5.28E+10 particles/ml, non-stimulated: 1.43E+11
particles/ml, p < 0.02).
Summary/Conclusion: Our results indicate that exo-
some depleted-media are not entirely devoid of vesi-
cles, which can cause bias in downstream analyses.
However, SEC is a good method to separate cell-
secreted EVs from the contaminating medium-derived
EVs. Culture medium did not affect the number of EVs
secreted by MSCs or neurons; instead, we observed
larger differences between media batches. This data
emphasizes the importance of analysing the NCC as
negative control in all cell culture experiments.

Introduction: It is largely demonstrated that stem cells
release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are able to modify
target cell behaviour. Interestingly, there is a bidirectional
signalling exchange between stem cell EVs and damaged
cells. Moreover, it is well known that macrophages, could
also play a role in wound repair and tissue regeneration. It
was also demonstrated that stem cell EVs are involved in
immune cell regulation. For this reason, today takes hold
the idea that EVs could replace stem cells in regenerative
medicine. The aim of our work was to evaluate if EVs
released by mouse mesoangioblast stem cells (A6) could
have a role in immune cell regulation. Specifically, we
have investigated the possible A6 EV effect on murine
macrophages (RAW264.7) in terms of cell proliferation,
migration and phagocytic ability, and cytokines/chemo-
kine release.
Methods: A6 EVs were collected from conditioned
milieu by ultracentrifugation. Raw 264.7 cell prolifera-
tion with or without A6 EVs was evaluated via CFSE
assay. Scratch test was performed to assay their migra-
tion ability. To study RAW264.7 cell phagocytosis they
were treated with 2 μm beads. Finally, cytokine array
was used to monitor their secretion after EV treatment.
Results: We have found that A6 EVs inhibited macro-
phage proliferation as proved by a proliferation index
significantly
reduced
after
EV
treatment.
Simultaneously, we have noticed that EVs increases
RAW264.7 migration ability. Furthermore, A6 EVs
are able to increase macrophage phagocytic activity.
As it is known that Hsp70 is involved in for macro-
phagic activity increase and A6 EVs express Hsp70 on
their surface, we performed phagocytosis assays assay
by blocking the protein or its receptor TLR2, TLR4 and
CD91. Our data demonstrated that A6 EVs increase
phagocytosis through Hsp70 and its receptors.
We have also proved that A6 EVs modify the
expression pattern of cytokines/chemokines released
in the extracellular milieu by RAW264.7 cells. In
particular, we observed an increase in anti inflam-
matory cytokines, and a decrease in some inflamma-
tory
ones,
suggesting
that
EVs
could
polarize
macrophages
towards
an
anti
inflammatory
M2
phenotype.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusions, our data show
that A6 EVs influence macrophage activity and addi-
tional studies could provide a new insight into under-
standing the underlying potential of EVs in tissue
regeneration.

Analytical ultracentrifugation identifies distinct populations of extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs) carrying the evolutionarily-conserved polycystin-2
protein in C. elegans

bRutgers University, New Brunswick, USA
Introduction: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
disease (ADPKD) affects ~1/800. ADPKD is one of the
most common, life threatening human genetic diseases
and leading cause of end-stage renal failure in adults
and children. 95% of ADPKD cases are caused by
mutations affecting the ciliary PKD1 and PKD2 com-
plex (Polycystic Kidney Disease 1 and 2). In a healthy
kidney, the polycystins localize to renal cilia. Mutations
that abrogate ciliary localization of PKD2 (yet preserve
its channel function) also cause cysts. Besides cilia,
PKD2 is also found in other subcellular locations
including extracellular vesicles (EVs) of human urine.
How dysfunction of PKD2 trafficking and localization
leads to the kidney pathology remains unknown.
PKD2 is evolutionarily conserved across all mem-
bers of Eumetazoa. In C. elegans, PKD-2 is exclusively
expressed in ciliated male-specific neurons, where it is
trafficked to cilia and EVs. GFP-tagged PKD-2-con-
taining EVs play a signalling role in inter-organismal
communication between animals. Conservation of
polycystin-2 cellular localization between worm and
human suggests that their network of molecular inter-
actions may also be conserved. We propose that PKD-2
plays distinct roles in cilia versus ciliary EVs.
Methods: To understand the role of EVs in C. elegans
inter-organismal signalling, we aim to identify the
PKD-2-associated EV proteome, transcriptome, and
metabolome. We established a pipeline for fluorescent
labelling and tracking specific EV cargoes in a living
animal using super-resolution microscopy. We used
fluorescence of the PKD-2 carrying EVs to optimize
biochemical procedures for their enrichment.
Results: Our initial analysis revealed two populations
of PKD-2-carrying EVs that differ in their densities:
1.11–1.12 versus 1.14 g/mL. We are currently charac-
terizing these two distinct populations using transmis-
sion electron microscopy and refining our enrichment
procedure for protein identification by mass spectro-
metry, sequencing of their RNA cargoes and metabo-
lome analysis.
Summary/Conclusion: What function human PKD2
plays within the cilia and within the urinary EVs is
not well understood. Identification of molecular med-
iators of C. elegans PKD-2 EV signalling will inform on
the interactome of human PKD2 and its function in
cilia versus EVs.

C. elegans ciliated sensory neurons release distinct subpopulations of
extracellular vesicles
Michael Clupper, Rachael Gill, Denis Touroutine and Jessica Tanis
University of Delaware, Newark, USA
Introduction: Ectosomes play roles in many physiolo-
gical and pathophysiological processes, and their pre-
cise is dependent on molecular cargo and parent cell
type. A single cell can release distinct subpopulations of
EVs enriched with different molecular cargo, which
adds complexity to elucidating cargo sorting and bio-
genesis mechanisms. In the nematode C. elegans, ecto-
somes bud from sensory neuron cilia and are released
into the environment to modulate animal behaviour.
Methods: C. elegans is genetically tractable and opti-
cally transparent, allowing for live imaging of fluores-
cently tagged EV cargo. We express all tagged cargo at
endogenous levels, adding physiological relevancy.
Results: We discovered that the calcium homoeostasis
modulator ion channel CLHM-1 localizes to cilia of

CLHM-1 in ciliary EVs. Using super resolution micro-
scopy, we imaged EVs released from animals co-
expressing tdTomato-tagged CLHM-1 and GFP-tagged
PKD-2 (another vesicle cargo) in the same neurons.
While the two proteins colocalize in the cilia, CLHM-
1::tdTomato and PKD-2::GFP rarely colocalize in EVs.
This indicates that separate subpopulations of EVs are
being released from the same neurons. To determine
how the CLHM-1 subpopulation is formed, we are
investigating candidate genes. ANOH-1, a homolog of
the Ca2+ scramblase TMEM16F, localizes to neuron
cilia and induces phosphatidylserine exposure on the
outer membrane leaflet. In anoh-1 mutants, the num-
ber of CLHM-1::GFP EVs released is significantly
decreased but the number of PKD-2::GFP EVs does
not significantly change. In addition, I am using
FACS to isolate CLHM-1 and PKD-2 containing EVs
and analysing the respective proteomes with LC-
MS/MS.
Summary/Conclusion: We are elucidating mechan-
isms that give rise to distinct subpopulations of cili-
ary EVs in C. elegans and defining cargoes being
enriched in these EV subpopulations to gain insight
into EV cargo sorting and biogenesis mechanisms in
ciliated neurons.

Ceramide accumulation induces exosome secretion through lysosomal
protein LAPTM4B
Kohei Yuyama, Hui Sun and Yasuyuki Igarashi
Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan
Introduction: Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicles
originated from multivesicular bodies (MVB), are
important carriers of cellular molecules and have cri-
tical roles in intracellular communication in both
health and disease. Ceramides (Cer) are implicated in
biogenesis of exosome, however the molecular machin-
ery that mediates exosome secretion remains obscure.
Lysosome-associated
protein
transmembrane-4B
(LAPTM4B) is a lysosome/late endosome-resident
transmembrane protein, which has been reported to
bind Cer. We demonstrate here that LAPTM4B is
involved in the exosome secretion, which are induced
by exogenous Cer treatment or lysosomal ceramidase
inhibition in cultured neuronal cells.
Methods: Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated
with Cer (porcine brain-derived Cer or synthetic
d18:1/C2:0~ C24:0 Cer) for 24 h. Exosomes were iso-
lated from the culture supernatants by sequential
centrifugation and their amounts were measured using
PS Capture exosome ELISA kit. To analyse MVB trans-
port, MVB and recycling endosomes are visualized with
GFP-CD63 and Rab11 immunostaining, respectively.
Results: We found that exogenous treatment of Cer,
especially those with C16 and C18 fatty acids, resulted
in a marked increase in exosome secretion. In addition,
lysosomal Cer accumulation induced by acid cerami-
dase inhibition also accelerated exosome production.
Knockdown of LAPTM4B significantly prevented the
ceramide-dependent exosome release. In addition, we
showed that these Cer loading promoted colocalization
of CD63-positive MVB with Rab11-positive recycling
endosomes,
further
demonstrated
that
LAPTM4B
knockdown cancelled the Cer-dependent increase of
the colocalization.
Summary/Conclusion: These data suggest that lysoso-
mal Cer binds to LAPTM4B and promote the transport
of MVB to plasma membrane, resulting in an increase
of exosome secretion in neuronal cells.

Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) are
signalling entities released by many types of eukaryotic
cells. sEV are of special interest in cancer due to their
reported roles in modulating the cancer microenviron-
ment
and
facilitating
cancer
cell
invasion.
Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a catabolic
process well-known for the recycling of cytosolic car-
gos through lysosome-mediated degradation. In this
study, we profiled the changes in sEV content and
function under lysosome inhibition and investigated
the involvement of autophagy machinery in sEV
content.
Methods: Chloroquine (CQ) was used to inhibit lyso-
somal degradation and autophagy turnover in triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. sEV were
collected via precipitation after pre-clearing and con-
centration of conditioned media. Western blotting,
NanoSight
and
transmission
electron
microscopy
were used to profile sEV. Quantitative mass spectro-
metry was used to characterize CQ-induced changes in
the sEV proteome. Antibody-conjugated magnetic
beads were used in immunoprecipitation of sEV.

Results: CQ treatment did not substantially alter the
physical properties of TNBC-derived sEV. However,
CQ treatment altered the sEV proteome and growth
effects of sEV on normal and endothelial recipient
cells. CQ treatment induced co-localization of mam-
malian ATG8 proteins with endolysosomal markers in
the cytoplasm, which coincided with an enrichment of
ATG8 s and their adaptor proteins in sEV. CQ-induced
enrichment of ATG8 s in sEV required lipidation, and
occured preferentially in one subset of sEV.
Summary/Conclusion: Our study reveals changes in
the content and function of cancer cell-derived sEV
in response to perturbation of intracellular trafficking
pathways, demonstrates the flexibility and heterogene-
ity of sEV composition, and has implications for CQ
efficacy in therapeutic settings.

Introduction: Introduction: Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is the
essential component of the RNA-Induced Silencing
Complex (RISC) that binds miRNAs and promotes
mRNA degradation. Extracellular vesicle (EV)-carried
miRNAs have been shown to influence gene expression
and functional phenotypes in recipient cells. Many
investigators have found Ago2 in EVs and it is postu-
lated that Ago2 is a major transporter of miRNAs into
small EVs (SEVs), such as exosomes. Others have
reported extracellular Ago2 that is non-vesicular. We
set out to evaluate the effect of growth factor signalling
and serum contamination on the detection of Ago2 in
SEVs.
Methods: Methods: Wildtype KRAS colorectal cancer
cells, DKs8, were conditioned with 3 different culture
media (serum-free DMEM, DMEM supplemented with
EV-depleted FBS, and Opti-MEM). EVs were purified
from conditioned media by cushion-density gradient
ultracentrifugation. Western blot analysis of DKs8 total
cell lysates, large EVs and density gradient fractions
was performed, probing for Ago2 and EV marker
proteins. The size and concentration of the EVs were
determined by Particle Metrix analysis.
Results: Results: In all conditions, we found the highest
abundance of SEVs in fractions 6 and 7, as assessed by
Western blot analysis. Ago2 was detected in the same
fractions as SEVs in both the serum-free DMEM and
Opti-MEM conditions, although the levels of Ago2 was
higher in the serum-free DMEM fractions compared to
that of Opti-MEM. In contrast, Ago2 was present in
both vesicular and non-vesicular fractions in the
DMEM supplemented with EV-depleted FBS condi-
tion. No significant differences were observed in the
size and number of EVs collected in the three condi-
tioning methods.
Summary/Conclusion: Summary/conclusion: The pre-
sence or absence of Ago2 in EVs has been controver-
sial. Multiple factors may affect the ability to detect
vesicular Ago2, including serum and growth factors
in the conditioned media that may provide sources of
extravesicular Ago2 and also regulate the trafficking of
Ago2 into vesicles.

Introduction: Cancer-associated glycosphingolipids
have been utilized as tumour markers and targets
of cancer therapy. We have investigated roles of
gangliosides in cancers, and clarified that cancer-
associated gangliosides enhance malignant properties
of cells by forming complexes with membrane mole-
cules in lipid rafts. In this study, we analysed con-
tents of gangliosides and membrane molecules on
extracellular vesicles (ECVs) secreted from mela-
noma cell lines.
Methods: Melanoma cell lines with various ganglioside
patterns were used for isolation of ECVs. Ganglioside-
modified melanomas with genetic engineering were
also used. Genetic modification was done by cDNAs
of ganglioside synthase genes. ECVs were collected by
ultra-centrifugation, or by Tim4-beads. Contents in
ECVs were analysed by immunoblotting or flow cyto-
metry. Roles of lipid rafts in the generation and secre-
tion of ECVs were analysed by treating cells with 1 mM
methyl β-cyclodextrin.

Results: Using 4 melanoma cell lines, ECVs were iso-
lated by ultra-centrifugation, and their sizes were ana-
lysed by NanoSight. All samples showed uniform sizes
between 100 and 200 nm. Protein amounts in ECVs
were
measured,
showing
heterogeneous
levels
at
10 ~ 80 μg/100 mL. Then, gangliosides expressed on
ECVs from these cell lines were analysed using Tim4-
beads and flow cytometry. GD3 and GD2 were
detected on ECVs almost proportionally with expres-
sion levels of those gangliosides on the cell surface.
Then, immunoblotting was performed to analyse integ-
rin levels in ECVs from transfectant cells expressing
high levels of GD3, showing increased levels of integ-
rins in ECVs from GD3+ cells compared with those
from GD3- cell lines. Integrin levels in cell lysates from
these cells (GD3+ and GD3 – cells) were almost
equivalent. Treatment of a GD3-expressing melanoma
cell line by 1 mM methyl β-cyclodextrin resulted in
marked reduction of secreted ECVs and amounts of
TSG101 in them.
Summary/Conclusion: Ganglioside expression pat-
terns on melanoma cells were well reflected in the
expression of gangliosides on ECVs. These results as
well as increased levels of integrins in ECVs from GD3
+ cells suggest that gangliosides and lipid rafts are
involved in the generation and secretion of ECVs.

Introduction: Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is a
common feature associated with tumour growth and
is known to regulate tumour cell function, especially
through rewiring of cell metabolism. However, how
hypoxia influences tumour cell interactions with sur-
rounding cells is not fully elucidated. We sought to
evaluate how hypoxia alters metabolite and metabo-
lism-associated miRNA packaging in exosomes.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from 4T1 breast
cancer cells cultured in normoxia (21% O2) and
hypoxia (5% O2) via ultracentrifugation, Optiprep gra-
dients, and size exclusion chromatography. Exosomes
were further characterized by Nanosight, Qubit protein
quantification, and flow cytometry analysis of exosome
markers. Metabolite and miRNA profiling was per-
formed on exosomes and exosome-producing cells in
normoxia and hypoxia.
Results: Secretion of exosomes was increased under
hypoxic
conditions.
Metabolite
profiling
revealed
alterations in metabolites specific to exosomes derived
from hypoxic cells. Profiling of exosomal miRNA
showed packaging of metabolism-related miRNA into
exosomes derived from hypoxic cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Hypoxia alters the metabolite
and miRNA profiles of cancer cells, with selective
packaging of these molecules into exosomes. We iden-
tified metabolites and miRNA that are depleted and
enriched in exosomes compared to cells. These studies
identify hypoxia-associated shifts in exosome cargo,
providing insight into exosome cargo packaging with
potential implications for understanding how cancer
cell-derived exosomes regulate recipient cell function.

Lysosomotropic agents prompts the release of extracellular vesicles carry-
ing autophagy-associated markers: evidence of a general mechanism of
secretion driven by lysosomal impairment

Emiliania

Introduction: Drug-induced lysosomal storage disor-
ders (LSDs) are due to the transient intracellular accu-
mulation, mostly of phospholipids, into multilamellar
inclusion bodies within late endosomal/lysosomal com-
partment. They represent a major side-effect for many
drugs of several pharmacological categories. Most LSDs
inducers are cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD), but the
molecular mechanisms leading to accumulation of
undigested substrates are unknown. Extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) have been implicated in cell waste disposal,
but it is unclear whether they might be involved in
extracellular release of undigested substrates.
Methods: To investigate this aspect, we developed Hek
cells stably expressing the fluorescent fusion proteins
EGFP-CD63 and mCherry-CD63, separated EVs by
differential ultracentrifugation and quantified by EV-
associated fluorescence and NTA particle count.
Results: EVs released by these models upon treatment
with drugs inducing the accumulation of phospholipids
(amiodarone)
or
glycosaminoglycans
(tilorone),
showed the release of fluorescent medium/large EVs

(10k fraction) and small EVs (100k fraction), whose
size and distribution were similar to the same vesicles
released by control cells, but enhanced the recovery of
medium/large EVs and to a lower extent of small EVs,
Analysis of EVs associated markers revealed a dose-
dependent increase of autophagy-associated markers in
medium/large and small EVs. Similar results were
obtained when autophagic flux was impaired by drugs
raising lysosomal pH by different mechanisms, such as
chloroquine and bafilomycin, but not when autophagic
flux was stimulated by drugs such as curcumin or
overexpression of the endosomal/lysosomal regulator
TFEB.
Summary/Conclusion:
Overall
results
show
that
impairment of autophagic flux, either by indigested
substrates or higher lysosomal pH, is associated with
an increased release EVs enriched in autophagy mar-
kers, compatible with autophagomes and/or amphi-
somes,

Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haemato-
logical tumour. Last decade, the prognosis of MM has
improved by the development of therapeutic drugs;
however, MM cells acquire drug resistance by long-
term exposure of these therapeutic drugs. One of the
possible explanations of drug resistance is that cells
with drug resistance transmit information to other
MM
cells
and
their
microenvironmental
cells.
Although the elucidation of the mechanism of drug
resistance in MM have been desired, it remains poorly
understood.
Methods: In order to understand the mechanism of
drug resistance in MM, lenalidomide resistant cell lines
were established by long-term exposure of low concen-
tration of lenalidomide. Drug resistance was assessed
by MTS assay and caspase assay. The amount of EV
was measured by ExoScreen, which is ultra-sensitive
detection method of EVs by measuring surface protein
of EVs, such as, CD9 and CD63 (Yoshioka et al., Nat
Commun., 2015). To identify the genes which involved
in drug resistance, RNA sequence among the drug-
resistant cell lines and their parental cell lines was
performed.
Results: Firstly, characterization of these cells was con-
firmed. We found that all of the lenalidomide resistant
cell lines secreted more EVs than their parental cell
lines. In addition to this, the size of EV derived from
resistant cells are smaller than those of parental cells.
Next, we collected EVs from resistant cells and parental
cells by using ultracentrifugation, and added them to
parental cells in the presence of lethal dose of lenalido-
mide. Compared with EV derived from parental cell
lines, the EVs derived from lenalidomide resistant cell
lines increased a number of living parental cells. These
results suggested that the EVs derived from lenalido-
mide resistant cells can affect the lenalidomide sensi-
tive cells.
As a result of RNA sequence, several genes
highly expressed in resistant cell line we found,
which associated with lysosome pathway. Among
them, attenuating the SORT1 and LAMP2 genes
could significantly reduce the EV secretion in MM
cells,
leading
to
enhance
the
lenalidomide
sensitivity.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results showed that EV
secretion via SORT1 or LAMP2 could induce the
drug resistance in MM.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are
pluripotent stromal cells known to release extracellular
vesicles (EVs) containing various growth factors and
antioxidants that can positively affect surrounding
cells. Nanoscale MSC-derived EVs, such as exosomes,
have been developed as bio-stable nano-type materials,
but had low yield and were difficult to quantify. We
hypothesized that the mechanism of nanoparticle-
enhanced exosome production would stimulate intra-
cellular molecules. The aim of this study was to eluci-
date the molecular mechanisms of exosome generation
by comparing the internalization of surface-modified
positively charged nanoparticles and exosome genera-
tion from MSCs.

Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cul-
tured in MEM-alpha with 10% FBS and 1× antibiotics.
The positively charged nanoparticles were synthesized
by Poly-lactide-co-glicolide (PLGA) and polyethyleni-
mine (PEI) with cy5.5 for tracking nanoparticles. All of
the exosome image were identified using an electron
microscope. Additionally, it was confirmed the inter-
nalization of the nanoparticles by IF. The primary
antibodies used were anti-EEA1, anti-Rab7 and anti-
GM130. In order to prove the development of exo-
somes, RT-PCR using autophagy-related mRNA was
performed. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using
the Applied Biosystems sequence detection system
7900. Lastly, miRNA from MSC-derived exosome ana-
lysed automatically in the Affymetrix data extraction
protocol using the provided Affymetrix GeneChip®
Command Console® Software (AGCC). All statistical
testing and visualization of differentially expressed
genes was conducted using R statistical language 3.3.3
Results: We determined that Rab7, located in the MVB
and autolysosomal membrane, was increased upon exo-
some expression and was associated with autophago-
some
formation.
These
results
suggested
that
nanoparticles migrated to lysosomes during treatment;
however, intracellular exosome-forming factors were sti-
mulated during endosomal maturation simultaneously.
Summary/Conclusion: Therefore, MSC-derived exo-
some research using nanoparticles is useful for increas-
ing exosome yield and the discovery of nanoparticle-
induced genetic factors.

Introduction: Understanding mechanisms of extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) formation is of utmost impor-
tance for their effective use in science, medicine and
technology. In particular, the discovery of universal
mechanisms explaining the phenomena taking place
in vesiculation appears to be crucial and highly war-
ranted. Mammalian erythrocytes and giant phospho-
lipid
vesicles
have
been
largely
used
as
model
systems to study principles of membrane budding
and vesiculation. The mechanisms conveniently stu-
died in these simple systems are then generalized to
other types of biological membranes. We present a
theoretical description of membrane budding and
compare the theoretically obtained shapes with the
observed ones.
Methods: In accordance with the fluid crystal mosaic
model, membrane is considered as composed of consti-
tuents (inclusions) subjected to the local curvature field
created by surrounding constituents. Constituents can
attain different in-plane orientations in the membrane
which correspond to different energies. The thermal
motion oposes the complete orientational ordering. The
single-constituent energy expresses a mismatch of the
curvature of the membrane at the position of the consti-
tuent and the intrinsic principal curvatures of the consti-
tuent and in – plane orientation of their principal axes.
The free energy of the whole membrane is obtained by
summing up (integration) the contributions of the con-
stituents and using methods of statistical physics, and
minimized by using numerical methods.
Results: To outline the principle of (outward and
inward) budding, respective sequences of shapes corre-
sponding to a formation of one (outward and inward)
spherical bud were calculated by minimization of the free
energy. Also the corresponding shapes observed in EVs
(imaged by electron microscopy) and in erythrocytes and
giant phospholipid vesicles (imaged by optical micro-
scopy) are shown. It can be seen that theoretically calcu-
lated shapes and experimentally observed ones agree well
over up to 3 orders of magnitude (the order of the size of
giant phospholipid vesicles is between 1 and 100 micro
metres, in erythrocytes it is about 5 micro metres and in
EVs it is about 100 nanometres).
Summary/Conclusion: Budding of the membrane is an
universal mechanism in formation of external and
internal vesicles.

Role of Arrdc4-mediated ubiquitination in extracellular vesicle biogenesis
and protein trafficking

Introduction: The release of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) from cells is important for many cellular
mechanisms both in normal physiology and in disease.
Arrdc4 (arrestin domain containing protein 4) is an
adaptor protein known to facilitate the ubiquitination
of target substrates by Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases.
It also traffics cargo to extracellular vesicles. Previous
studies show the involvement of Arrdc4 in the traffick-
ing of the divalent metal ion transporter DMT1 to EVs
in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, and we aimed to
further understand this mechanism.
Methods:
We
performed
mass
spectrometry
to
identify ubiquitinated lysine residues in Arrdc4.
We then generated Arrdc4 WT and lysine mutant
clones and expressed these in cells to determine the
effect on EV biogenesis and protein trafficking.
Results: Mass spectrometry data identified 5 potential
ubiquitinated lysine residues. Out of these, lysine 270
appeared to be the most important for Arrdc4 func-
tion. Arrdc4K270 R mutation caused a decrease in the
number of EV released by the cell compared to
Arrdc4 WT, and a reduction in trafficking of DMT1
to EVs. Furthermore, we also observed a decrease in
DMT1 activity and an increase in its intracellular
degradation in the presence of Arrdc4K270 R. K270
also appeared to be ubiquitinated with K29 polyubiqui-
tin chains by the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggests that K29
polyubiquitin
chains
are
the
signal
for
Arrdc4-
mediated EV biogenesis and protein trafficking, and
loss of this signal causes cargo to be rerouted to intra-
cellular degradation mechanisms.

Introduction: Explaining the field of extracellular vesi-
cles to the lay public and young audiences can often be
challenging. Whilst diagrams and images of EVs may
be helpful, conveying clearly the shape and composi-
tion of an EV by these means is not always a success.
Whilst many members of the audience may be familiar
with concepts of cells and related structures, others will
find such discussions very abstract and challenging. In
order to aid interactions with lay audiences we
embarked on the design of a physical hand-held plastic
model, representing a typical EV. Incorporating flex-
ibility in the design allowing the community to adapt it
to showcase their own research. The second goal was to
ensure manufacturability using widely available 3D-
printing technologies.
Methods: The basic model design was conceived by Dr
C. Burton, and iteratively developed using Solidworks,
2019, then exported for use in any CAD environment
(STL format). A model showing a halved EV hemi-
sphere, with a visible lipid-bilayer was developed.
Attachable rings allow trans-membrane-molecules to
be represented, current designs include MHC Class-I,
HSPGs, integrins, tetraspanins and supported by hand-
outs accompanying the models. Intraluminal cargo is
included via removeable “pegs”, and examples repre-
senting RNA or simple globular proteins, and a template
has been created.
Results: The design is free and open source, and avail-
able to the community at: https://www.thingiverse.
com/thing:3986565. Instructions for 3D printing are
available from the UK Extracellular Vesicle Society
website;
https://www.ukev.org.uk/public-engagement-
materials/. Models have been produced using entry-
level 3D printers and trialled at engagement events
with good early responses.
Summary/Conclusion: The authors hope the commu-
nity will use and develop this 3D-model design and
that the approach provides an additional and helpful
tool for educating audiences about the complexities
and roles of EVs in biology and disease.

Introduction: Despite recent developments in breast
cancer therapy, there is still need for a more targeted
approach. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), endogenous
nanovesicles released from human cells, are an attrac-
tive choice as nanodrug carriers due to their size,
stability and their unique targeting specificity. The
aim of this study was to determine if centrifugal filtra-
tion (CF) combined with size exclusion chromatogra-
phy (CF-SEC) would be useful for EV isolation from
two epithelial breast cell lines D492 and D492HER2+,
representing the tissue of interest, and the amount of
cell
culture
needed
to
get
measurable

Methods: Cell culture media (without serum) from the
immortalized breast epithelial cell lines D492 and
D492HER2+ was concentrated with centrifugal filtra-
tion (CF) followed by isolation with size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC) using HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl
S-400 column run with ÄKTA Start (280 nm), 240 min
runs. Each fraction (4–5 ml) was collected with fraction
collector. Dulbecco’s particle free PBS was used as
mobile phase. The resulting particles were analysed
with nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA, NanoSight
NS300, camera gain 10, static mode, capture time
90 sec), western blotting (WB), microBCA and trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM, samples fixed with
2% formaldehyse and stained with 2% uranyl acetate,
run at 80kV).
Results: Although SEC did not show any prevalent
peaks from early eluting regions previously shown to

contain extracellular vesicles, these fractions (F1-F3,
40–130 min) were collected from D492HER2+ cell cul-
ture medium. Interestingly, both NTA and TEM sug-
gest that F2 and F3 contained EVs as the isolated
particles measured 65 and 58 nm, respectively and
TEM revealed spherical particles 20–50 nm in dia-
meter. WB was unable to detect the EV associated
protein Alix (but was present in the whole cell lysate).
Soluble proteins and protein aggregates eluted late in
the SEC chromatogram (180 min), with protein analy-
sis (microBCA), TEM and WB confirming their
presence.
Summary/Conclusion: CF-SEC is a promising method
for EV isolation for pharmaceutical applications, but
further work is needed to optimize the isolation pro-
cess using ÄKTA Start for these cell lines.

Introduction: Since its founding in 2012, ISEV has
sought to further extracellular vesicle research in var-
ious ways including scientific meetings. These events
encompass annual meetings as well as smaller, topically
focused workshops, with the first ISEV Workshop (on
RNA and EVs) organized in New York City in
October, 2012. In December, 2019, the Workshop
“Open, Reproducible, and Standardized EV Research”
was held in Ghent, Belgium. In March, 2020, the
Workshop, “EVs in Immunology” was held in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, with a preceding Education Day.
Methods: The international organizing committees of
the 2019 and 2020 ISEV Workshops prepared scientific
programs around key themes of EV rigour and stan-
dardization (Ghent, Belgium, 2019 workshop) and EVs
in immunology (Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2020 work-
shop). Abstract and application submissions were
invited. Applications were reviewed and ranked by
panels of EV experts for each event, and participants
were invited.
Results: The 2019 and 2020 Workshops assembled a
total of more than 100 individuals for talks and discus-
sions around the themes of Rigour and Standardization
and EVs in Immunology. The Buenos Aires Workshop
was preceded by an Education Day, coordinated by the
ISEV Executive Committees for Education and Science

and Meetings. During these two workshops, poster
presentations were permitted for the first time, afford-
ing additional presentation and interaction opportu-
nities. The Rigour and Standardization Workshop
also featured real-time discussant polling to facilitate
discussion.
Summary/Conclusion: ISEV workshops such as those
addressing Rigour and Standardization (Ghent, 2019)
and EVs in Immunology (Buenos Aires, 2020) con-
tinue to provide opportunities for focused discussion
of small groups of experts on key topics in the field.
Often followed by published products, ISEV workshops
help to lead and coordinate progress in EV science. For
future ISEV workshops, educational activities may
again expand the reach of each event, while poster
sessions and app-driven real-time responses should be
considered for enhanced interactions and participant
canvassing.

EV Journal Club: exchanging pizza for a worldwide audience during
COVID-19
Kenneth W. Witwer
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA
Introduction: A monthly journal club focused on
extracellular vesicle science was established at Johns
Hopkins University in 2016, featuring lunch and pre-
sentations by academic and industry participants.
When COVID-19 prevented in-person meetings begin-
ning in March, 2020, the journal club was converted to
a virtual, weekly format on the popular online meeting
app Zoom. The journal club has persisted despite
initial problems with online vandalism. Most sessions
are also made public on a YouTube channel, https://
www.youtube.com/c/ExtracellularVesicleClub.
Methods: Weekly EV Club sessions are arranged by the
host. Most focus on a specific manuscript related to
EVs, but some weeks feature presentations of published
or soon-to-be-published research by the presenting
authors. Sessions are advertised one week to several
days in advance on social media platforms such as
LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, asking interested par-
ties to sign up to join a mailing list via SurveyMonkey.
The log-in information is then sent to the mailing list.
Upon clicking the link, participants are placed in a
virtual waiting room for vetting by the host and volun-
teers. After admission, all parties but the host and
presenter are muted to avoid distractions. Questions
and
comments
may
be
placed
in
a
chat
box.
Contributions are monitored and compiled by the
host and volunteers to build a question-and-answer
session at the end of the presentation. Recorded ses-
sions–with or without editing as needed–are placed on
the YouTube channel for additional access.
Results: Despite initial problems with online vandalism
known as “Zoombombing,” the journal club has con-
tinued weekly during the COVID-19 shutdown in the
host country (US). An audience of between 80 and 150
individuals is typical. Participants typically ask more
questions than can be answered in a one-hour time
frame. The online format also allows for debate-style
events and polling of the audience.
Summary/Conclusion: This EV Journal Club is an
example of how online tools can be used to facilitate
international scientific interactions. Further develop-
ment
of
such
formats
could
provide
alternative
approaches
for
ISEV
activities
in
the
Science,
Education, and Communication areas.

Introduction: Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is a systemic air-
way disease involving the respiratory tract. Lifestyles
and environmental factors (e.g. particulate matter, PM)
have a role in disease pathogenesis and recurrence.
The study aim is to assess whether the exposure to
PM10 and PM2,5, chosen as paradigmatic environ-
mental stressors, could modify the composition of
nasal microbiota (NM) and extracellular vesicle (EV9
signalling network, showing a role in allergic AR
exacerbation).
Methods: NM analysis were performed on V3-V4 16 S
rRNA gene regions amplified from upper-airway tracts
of 25 AR cases and 25 healthy individual controls to
perform NM analyses. EV size, concentration and cel-
lular origin for each subject were assessed by nanopar-
ticle tracking analysis (NTA) and flow-cytometry (FC).
Information on daily PM10 and PM2,5 concentrations
at the municipality of residence in the 7 days preceding
nasal sampling (i.e. Day −1 to Day −7) was assigned to
each subject by ArcGIS software. Multivariable and
logistic analyses were applied on NM, NTA and FC
outcomes.
Results: When taxonomy composition was considered,
in controls Actinobacteria (50.8%) was the most repre-
sented,
followed
by
Firmicutes
(34.7%)
and
Proteobacteria (12.8%) while in cases Proteobacteria
were
38.8%,
Actinobacteria
were
37.1%
and
Firmicutes were 23.4%.
Cases showed a higher concentration of all the
investigated EV types, derived from platelets (CD61
+), activated endothelium (CD62e+), monocytes
(CD14+),
eosinophils
(CD294+),
neutrophils
(CD177+), mastocytes (CD203 c+), epithelial cells
(EPCAM+), GRAM+ bacteria (Lipoteichoic Acid+),
GRAM- bacteria (LPS+). The effect was greatest in
the case of mastocytes EVs which were increased 2.5-
fold in cases versus controls (p < 0.001). EVs were
modified by PM exposure at several time lags. In
particular, a negative association between PM10
and eosinophil EVs was observed (beta = −0,016; p-
value = 0,017).
As we clustered subjects according to their NM,
we observed this variable was a strong effect modifier
of the association between PM exposure and EV
release.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings start to provide
an insight on the effect of air pollution on EVs,
taking into account the effect of NM, in patients
with AR. Further research is necessary to disentangle
the mechanism exerted by inhaled pollutants in
modulating
EVs
and
NM,
and
therefore
AR
exacerbation.

contributing to disease progression, and poor response
to therapy. Th17 cell is actively involved in worsening
smooking-associates inflammation mediated by Aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a cytoplasmic transcrip-
tion factor involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Both,
AhR and Th17 cells, has important implications during
RA development. Considering that cigarette smoke is a
potent epigenetic modifier, we hypothesized that AhR
activation, by cigarette components, would transcribe
specific microRNAs in Th17 cells as a molecular
mechanism to exacerbate inflammation in arthritis.
Methods: MicroRNA expression was evaluated by large-
scale approach or real-time PCR. C57/BL6 and AhR null
mice were submitted to arthritis experimental models
and exposed or not to cigarrete smoke (ethical commit-
tee approved 048/2012). Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and characterized
by western blot and nanosight. RANKL-induced osteo-
clasts (OCs) differentiation in vitro was stained for
TRAP. Inhibition of miRNAs were performed using
anti-miRs transfection.
Results: We identified a specific group of miRNAs
induced in Th17 cells after AhR activation. During
arthritis progression, the microRNAs are expressed and
increases after exposure to cigarette smoke. In the
absence of AhR their levels were drastically reduced.
Interestingly, we found that these microRNAs are
released by Th17 cells into EVs, and are able to promote
osteoclastogenesis. OCs differentiation in vitro increases
in the presence of Th17-derived EVs, and this process is
reduced in the absence of microRNAs.
Summary/Conclusion: MicroRNA-mediated gene reg-
ulation plays crucial roles in the immune system func-
tions,
and
their
abnormal
expression
is
highly
correlated with the pathogenesis of RA. EVs are
known to function in cell-to-cell communication and
are able to transmit their contents and cause changes in
the target cell. Our findings demonstrate a new mole-
cular mechanism by which cigarette smoke could
aggravate inflammation in arthritis; through the activa-
tion of AhR receptor in Th17 cells, inducing the tran-
scription of specific microRNAs that are released into
EVs, and act as pro-inflammatory mediators.

Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the
flagellated protozoan T. cruzi. Trypomastigote forms
are capable of releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs) that
contain the major surface molecules of the parasite.
The parasite has a complex life cycle that leads to it a
rapid adaptation in the environmental changes in the
hosts. However, the effects of stress on on EVs release
are not completely understood. Objetive: we evaluated
the release of EVs by trypomastigotes incubated under
different stress conditions and the immunomodulatory
role of these EVs in pre-activated bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDM).
Methods: Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and
scanning
electron
microscopy
(SEM)
showed
an
increase in EVs releasing by trypomastigotes at 4°C
under acidic conditions, EVs released was affected
and triggered amastigogenesis process.
Results: Treatment with sodium azide (NaN3) also
caused changes in the release of EVs regarding size
and concentration. Nitrosative stress caused by sodium
nitrite (in culture medium mildly acidic, pH 5.5; in this
condition NaNO2 releases Nitric Oxide) stimulated an
increase in production of EVs by T. cruzi. When the
parasites were treated with 100 nM S-nitrosoglu-
tathione (SNOG), we observed a reduction in size and
concentration of vesiculate material by trypomasti-
gotes. At a higher SNOG concentration (100 µM), the
concentration of the vesiculate material increased. T.
cruzi-derived
EVs
exposed
to
stress
conditions
increased the expression of iNOS, Arg 1, IL-12 and
IL-23 genes in IFN-γ and LPS pre-activated BMMs.
Summary/Conclusion: Results suggest that the viabi-
lity and/or integrity of the parasite are necessary for the
EVs releasing. In those in vitro conditions they trig-
gered a proinflammatory response in host cells. This
may be a strategy developed by the parasite to favour
its establishment in the host.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
been widely used to the field of autoimmune diseases
or tissue regeneration therapy. Recently, many research
groups have reported that MSCs showed their ability via
secreted paracrine mediators including extracellular
vesicles (EVs) rather than cell-to-cell contact. MSCs
mainly exist on bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbili-
cal cord and adipose and can mostly secrete EVs. It has
emerged that EVs alone are responsible for the thera-
peutic effect of MSCs in plenty of animal diseases mod-
els. Hence, MSC-derived EVs may be used as an
alternative MSC-based therapy in regenerative medicine.
Methods: As part of safety programme for human thera-
peutics, we performed immunotoxicological assessment of
EVs obtained from human MSCs (hEVs) in mice and
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs).
Firstly, mice were treated intravenously with a negative
control, a positive control (LPS; 0.4 mg/kg), or low-dose
(1x10e8 paticles/head) and high-dose (1x10e9 paticles/
head) of hEVs every other day for 10 days and then ana-
lysed lymphocyte subsets from collected spleen by FACS.
Next, we treated the EVs on hPBMCs for 3 days
with low conc. (1x10e8 particles/ml), high conc.
(1x10e9 particles/ml), PMA/Ionomycin as a cell activa-
tor or CPT (10 μM) as an apoptotic inducer. Annexin
V/PI and CSFE were analysed by FACS.
Results: As a result, splenic NK cells and B cells were
slightly increased about 2 ~ 7% in hEVs- treated mice,
without biological significance, compared with a positive
control (LPS) as an immunogenicity inducer. And there
were no effects on serum levels of inflammatory cytokines
in mice. In addition, hEVs had no cytotoxic effect on
hPBMCs at both low and high conc. Under the culture
medium with EVs-depleted FBS, the hEVs appeared mini-
mal anti-apoptotic effect on hPBMCs. For the CFSE assay,
the hEVs showed slight proliferation on hPBMCs and
PBMC activation induced by PMA/Ionomycin.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, the hEVs have
little
immuno-toxicological
effects
in
mice
and
hPBMCs. Further detailed studies to elucidate immu-
nological response of hEVs for development of human
therapeutics are needed.

Introduction: Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived extra-
cellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are thought to be a finger-
print of the secreting cell and therefore may retain the
cancer targeting and immune privilege of MSCs. Thus
MSC-EVs hold immense potential as tumour-targeted
therapeutics for breast cancer. The aim of this study
was to determine whether MSC-EV administration in
tumour bearing immunocompetent animals would
initiate an immune response.
Methods: EVs were isolated from conditioned media of
both human and murine bone marrow-derived MSCs
through sequential differential centrifugation, micro-
filtration and ultracentrifugation. EVs were character-
ized
by
Nanoparticle
Tracking
Analysis
(NTA),
Western Blot and Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM). 1 x 10(8) human or murine MSC-EVs were
administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour
bearing Balb/c mice (n = 6) and healthy controls
(n = 6). Tumour tissue, draining lymph node and
spleen were then harvested, dissociated and flow cyto-
metry performed targeting markers associated with a
range of immune cells including T-cells, macrophages
and natural killer (NK) cells.
Results: EVs were successfully isolated from murine
and human MSCs with the appropriate size of small
EVs (sEVs: 30–150 nm) and morphology including a
lipid bilayer observed by TEM. EVs expressed tetraspa-
nins CD63, CD81, CD82; Cytosolic protein TSG101
and were negative for Calnexin. EV concentrations
ranged from 4.08 x 10(9) – 6.6 x 10(9)/ml. In order
to study a range of immune cell populations two anti-
body panels were created using complimentary fluor-
escent dyes. The proportion of T-cells (CD4+, CD8+,
CD25+), Neutrophils (GR-1+, LY-6 C+), Dendritic
cells (CD11 c+), Macrophages (CD11b+, MHCI+,
MHCII+), NK cells (CD27+) and B cells (CD19+)
remained stable in the tumour, draining lymph node
and spleen of all tumour-bearing animals that received

change observed in any category.
Summary/Conclusion: The data presented supports
the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune pri-
vilege of the secretory cell, with human cell-derived
EVs illiciting no immune response in mice. This is
encouraging and reinforces the potential for use of
MSC-EVs in the therapeutic setting.

Introduction: Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) is a
slow
growth
rate non-tuberculous
mycobacterium
(NTM). M. avium infection is a severe global health
problem. But the mechanisms of pathogenicity of M.
avium are poorly understood. Outer membrane vesicles
(OMVs) that traverse the cell wall and contain a varied
bioactive components inculding DNA, RNA, protein
and toxins. Previous studies have suggested that these
OMVs are produced in vitro and during animal infec-
tion, but the role of OMVs secretion during the inter-
action of M. avium with host cells remains unknown.
Methods: In this study, M. avium were grown in
Middlebrook 7H9 medium (M7H9) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) OADC enrichment and 0.5% (v/v)
glycero. M. avium OMVs were isolated by ultracentri-
fugation method. Characterization of OMVs by trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA). The RAW 264.7 murine
macrophages were incubated with the M. avium
OMVs to analyse inflammatory response and produc-
tion of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) of macrophage.
Results: In this study, we demonstrate by fluorescence
microscopy that murine macrophages can phagocytosis
OMVs produced by M. avium. Incubation of M. avium
OMVs with murine macrophages resulted in increased
levels of extracellular tumour necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), terleukin-6 (IL-6)
and interleukin-12 (IL-12). Meanwhile OMVs stimu-
lated macrophages produce NO and ROS.
Summary/Conclusion: The above results indicate that
the outer membrane vesicles of M. avium could stimu-
late macrophage function and induce inﬂammatory
immune responses comparable to M. avium infection
but do not cause cell apoptosis. Our findings suggest
that M. avium secretory outer membrane vesicles have
the potential to influence the interaction of M. avium
with host cells.

Hospital, Washington, USA; cChildrens National Hospital, Washington, USA
Introduction: Hospital associated venous thromboem-
bolism (HA-VTE) in paediatric patients is the second
most common contributor to harm in hospitalized chil-
dren. Platelet-endothelial interactions are integral to the
formation of VTE, especially in inflammatory condi-
tions such as sepsis. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
have the ability to reprogramme target cell phenotypes
via their microRNA contents and are known to contri-
bute to VTE formation. We hypothesize that sepsis
alters platelet-derived sEV microRNAs capable of net
upregulation of vascular endothelial procoagulant and
downregulation of anticoagulant pathways.
Methods: Using a precipitation solution and size exclu-
sion chromatography, we isolated sEVs from platelet
poor plasma of children admitted to the paediatric
intensive care unit for sepsis and from healthy controls.
We positively selected platelet-derived sEVs using
immunomagnetic isolation for CD42B platelet antigen
and
confirmed
selection
using
flow
cytometry.
MicroRNA was profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip
miRNA 4.0 array.
Results: MicroRNA from 9 sepsis patients (median age
7.0 years; IQR:1.2–13 and 77% female) with a median
pSOFA score of 6 (IQR:2.5–10) and from 5 healthy
controls (median age 9 years; IQR:6.5–13.5 and 20%
female) was isolated and compared. In septic vs.
healthy
patients
30
miRNAs
were
differentially
expressed (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05; fold change
≥|1.5|) affecting 921 mRNA pathways. In septic chil-
dren, pathways affecting chemotaxis and cell move-
ment of leukocytes were predicted to be activated
with z-scores ≥2.

T cell-exosome-derived miR-142-3p impairs glandular cell function in
Sjögren´s syndrome

Bethesda, USA
Introduction: Sjögren´s syndrome (SS) is a systemic
autoimmune disease that mainly affects salivary and
lacrimal glands. Mechanisms of SS pathogenesis are
poorly understood. It is thought that inflammation
leads to destruction of exocrine glands, however the
triggers of autoimmunity and the mechanisms by
which inflammation drives immunopathology are not
characterized. Our work identifies T cell-exosome-
derived miR-142-3p as a pathogenic driver of immu-
nopathology in SS. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endo-
genous small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate
the expression of target genes through translational
repression of mRNAs. Through transcriptomic profil-
ing studies our group had previously documented a
significant upregulation of miR-142-3p in patient SS
tissues and in serum exosomes.
Methods: Structured search for target genes of miR-
142-3p involved in salivary gland (SG) physiology was
performed with mirDIP 4. SERCA2b, RyR2 and AC9
were selected for further validation and functional
analysis. Binding of the miRNA was confirmed by
luciferase reporter assays in HSG cell lines and
human-derived primary epithelial cells. The mRNA
and protein levels of SERCA2b, RyR2 and AC9 were
determined by qPCR and Western blot, respectively.
To investigate the cell-specific distribution of miR-142-
3p in relation to the expression levels of SERCA2b,
RYR2, and AC9, a double fluorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion was performed. Ca2+ signalling and cAMP levels
were measured using fluorescent sensor. To isolate
exosomes, the T cell medium and serum of SS-patients
and healthy volunteers (HV) were collected.
Results: We show that miR-142-3p is over-expression
in the SGs of SS-patients. Next, we demonstrated that
miR-142-3p is contained in exosomes in serum of SS-
patients significantly more than serum of HV. We also
show that activated T cells secrete exosomes containing
miR-142-3p which transfer into glandular cells and
affecting intracellular Ca2+ signalling, cAMP produc-
tion and protein production by miR-142-3p targets
(SERCA2B, RyR2 and AC9).
Summary/Conclusion: This study provides evidence
for a functional role of the miR-142-3p in SS pathogen-
esis and promotes the concept that T cell-activation
directly may impair epithelial cell function through
secretion of mi-RNA containing exosomes.

Introduction: Interleukin-35 (IL35) is an immunosup-
pressive cytokine composed of Epstein-Barr-virus-
induced protein 3 (Ebi3) and IL12-alpha chain (p35)
subunits, yet the forms that IL35 assumes and its role
in peripheral tolerance, remain elusive.
Methods: We induce CBA-specific, IL35-producing T
regulatory (Treg) cells in TregEbi3 WT C57BL/6 repor-
ter mice, and identify IL35 producers by expression of
Ebi3TdTom gene reporter, plus Ebi3 and p35 proteins.
Results: Curiously, both subunits of IL35 were dis-
played on the surface of tolerogen-specific Foxp3
+ and Foxp3neg (iTr35) T cells. Furthermore, IL35
producers, although rare, secrete Ebi3 and p35 on
extracellular vesicles (EV) targeting a 25- to 100-fold
higher number of T and B lymphocytes, causing them
to acquire surface IL35. This surface IL35 is absent
when EV/exosome production was inhibited, or if
Ebi3 is genetically deleted in Treg cells.

Introduction: An exosome-APC circuit we uncovered
may be applicable beyond skin immunity we study in
mice.
Methods: High antigen dose tolerized CD8 + T cells
make suppressive antigen-specific exosomes due to
chosen surface antibody light chains that enable target-
ing antigen presenting cells (APC) antigen-specifically
for delivery of also chosen inhibitory miRNA-150 to
mediate specific functional gene alterations.
Results: Both antigen and gene specificity aspects are
lent to naïve but activated exosomes by simple in vitro
incubations alone. For mechanism, these primary exo-
somes bind antigen peptides in MHC on APC that in
turn make secondary suppressive exosomes that act
peptide/MHC-specifically on the effector T cells at the
immune synapse. They transfer another miRNA for
strong prolonged inhibition of active delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) for days even, when the pri-
mary
miRNA-150-pos
exosomes
are
administered
orally at the height of the in vivo response, in a phy-
siological dose.
Summary/Conclusion: It is shown possible to induce
therapeutic exosomes with Ag targeting of choice due
to placed Ab on the surface and that also target specific
gene functions of acceptor cells due to carriage of a
selected miRNA. This dual Ag and gene-specific ther-
apy
has
applications
in
treatment

The role of Mac-1 and calcium signalling in the formation of neutrophil
granulocyte derived extracellular vesicles
Viktória Szeiferta, Ákos M. Lőrinczb and Erzsébet Ligetia
aDepartment of Physiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary;
bSemmelweis University, Department of Physiology, Budapest, Hungary
Introduction: Previously, our group characterized dis-
tinct populations of extracellular vesicle (EV) released
from neutrophilic granulocytes: EV formed sponta-
neously (sEV) and upon activation with opsonized
particles (aEV). The aEV differs in protein cargo and
its ability to inhibit bacterial growth. We described that
Mac-1 integrin (CR3 receptor) plays key role in the
aEV production and extracellular calcium supply is
crucial in this signalization. In the present work, our
aim was to investigate whether Mac-1 activation or Ca-
signalling on their own are sufficient for the initiation
of the aEV biogeneis.
Methods: We isolated neutrophil derived EVs from
peripheral human blood and murine bone marrow by
two-step centrifugation and filtration. We tested the
effect of Ca-ionophore and examined the EV produc-
tion on C3bi coated surface and in soluble form. We
quantified the vesicles by flow cytometry and deter-
mined their protein content by Bradford assay. We
examined their antibacterial effect in parallel with opti-
cal density-based measurement and our flow cytometry
based method.
Results: On C3bi coated surface, we observed an
increased EV production, and these EVs possessed
antibacterial capacity. However, in soluble condi-
tion, C3bi did not induce further EV production,
and these EVs did not show any antibacterial prop-
erty. We found that Ca-ionophore initiated EV for-
mation, but these EV did not show antibacterial
effect. We observed EV production increase after
Ca-ionofore treatment both in the presence and in
the absence of extracellular Ca. The Ca-ionophore
slightly increased the opsonized particle induced EV
production, but did not potentiate their antibacter-
ial capacity.
Summary/Conclusion: Mac-1 activation is not just
crucial, but sufficient in initiation of the aEV biogen-
esis. Clustering of this receptor is required. While the
Ca-signal is crucial, it is not sufficient in the generation
of aEVs.

Extracellular vesicles and their microRNA cargo in retinal health and
degeneration: mediators of homoeostasis, and immune modulation
Yvette S. M. Wooff, Adrian Cioanca, Riemke Aggio-Bruce, Joshua Chu-Tan,

Introduction: Photoreceptor cell death and inflamma-
tion are known to occur progressively in retinal degen-
erative
diseases
such
as
age-related
macular
degeneration (AMD). However, the molecular mechan-
isms regulating these biological processes are largely
unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are essential med-
iators of cell-to-cell communication with emerging
roles in the modulation of immune responses. EVs,
including
exosomes,
encapsulate
and
transfer
microRNA (miRNA) to recipient cells and in this way
can modulate the environment of recipient cells.
Dysregulation of EVs however is correlated to a loss
of cellular homoeostasis and increased inflammation.
In this work we investigated the role of isolated retinal
small-medium sized EV (s-mEV) in the regulation of
homoeostasis and immune modulation in both the
healthy and degenerating retina.
Methods: Isolated s-mEV from healthy and degenera-
tive (photo-oxidative damaged) mouse retinas were
characterized using dynamic light scattering, transmis-
sion electron microscopy and western blot, and quan-
tified using nanotracking analysis. Small RNA-seq was
used to characterize the miRNA cargo of retinal s-mEV
isolated from healthy and degenerating retinas. Finally,
the effect of exosome inhibition on s-mEV-mediated
immune modulation was investigated using systemic
daily administration of exosome inhibitor GW4869
and analysed by in situ hybridization of s-mEV-abun-
dant miRNA. Electroretinography and immunohisto-
chemistry were performed to assess functional and
morphological changes to the retina as a result of
exosome depletion.
Results: Our results demonstrated an inverse corre-
lation between s-mEV concentration and photore-
ceptor
survival,
with
decreased
s-mEV
numbers
following
retinal
degeneration.
Small
RNA-seq
revealed that s-mEVs contained uniquely enriched
miRNAs, however no differential composition in s-
mEV
miRNA
cargo
following
photo-oxidative
damage was observed. Exosome inhibition using
GW4869
exacerbated
photoreceptor
degeneration,
with reduced retinal function and increased levels
of
inflammation
and
cell
death
seen
following
photo-oxidative damage. Further, reduced transloca-
tion
of
the
photoreceptor-derived
s-mEV
was
demonstrated
following
exosome-inhibition
in
photo-oxidative damaged mice.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, we propose
that retinal s-mEV and their miRNA cargo play an
essential role in maintaining retinal homoeostasis
through immune-modulation, and have the potential
to be targeted using gene therapy for retinal degenera-
tive diseases.

Impacts of agricultural dust exposure on human lung-resident mesench-
ymal stromal/stem cells and their extracellular vesicles
Stefanie N. Sveiven, Gary B. Adkins, Wenwan Zhong and Tara M. Nordgren
University of California, Riverside, Riverside, USA
Introduction: Agricultural dust is considered a high-risk
occupational hazard by the CDC, with impacts reaching
throughout the communities surrounding these indus-
tries, leading to increased incidence of respiratory illness
and disease among individuals within this occupation
and these communities. Lung-resident mesenchymal
stromal/stem cells (lr-MSC) have an important role in
maintaining homoeostasis in the lung, and mediating
pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly during
exposure to inhaled irritants, like agricultural dust. One
way in which these lr-MSC promote lung homoeostasis is
through the release of extracellular vesicles (EV), with a
variety of cargo that elicit changes among target cells. We
hypothesize that exposure to agricultural dust modifies
the quantity and cargo of EV released by lr-MSC to
promote lung tissue homoeostasis.
Methods: Primary human lung-resident mesenchy-
mal stromal cells were exposed to extracts of dusts
collected from swine confinement facilities (DE) for
8 or 48hrs and the media from these exposures were
collected and enriched for EV by opti-prep density
gradient ultracentrifugation. The quantity of these
EV were assessed by nanoparticle tracking analysis.
Additionally, cytokine and chemokine release by lr-
MSC
were
analysed
by
enzyme-linked
immuno
assays.
Results: As assessed at 48 hr following treatment, DE-
exposed lr-MSC released pro-inflammatory cytokines,
IL-6 and IL-8, with IL-8 release reaching statistical
significance at 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% DE concentrations

(p = 0.0367, <0.0001, and <0.0001 respectively) and IL-
6 trending a similar dose response but only statistically
significant at 1% DE (p = <0.0001). DE exposure of lr-
MSC also induced changes in the lr-MSC-derived EV
populations when compared to vehicle control, where
lr-MSC released significantly more EV in the 5 and
10% iodixanol fractions (p = <0.0001 and 0.0219,
respectively)
at
8
hr
following
DE
treatment.
Alternatively, there were significantly less EV in the
20 and 40% density fractions in the media of DE-
exposed lr-MSC versus vehicle control.
Summary/Conclusion: Following exposure to agricul-
tural dusts, lr-MSC-derived EV populations more likely
consist of exosomes and ectosomes, which play an
important role in promoting lung tissue homoeostasis
during exposure-related pulmonary inflammation.

Introduction: During analyses of single extracellular
vesicles (EVs) by flow cytometry (FCM), particles
below the detection limit may exceed the trigger
threshold, which is called swarm detection and gener-
ates false-positive counts. Serial dilutions are recom-
mended to find the minimal dilution for which swarm
detection is absent. However, because particle concen-
trations in plasma vary, the optimal dilution differs
>100-fold between donors, but it is unfeasible to do
serial dilutions for each clinical sample. Therefore, our
aims are to (1) develop a faster method to avoid swarm
detection, and (2) increase the number of detected EVs
per second.
Methods: We measured serial dilutions of CD61-
stained EVs in platelet free plasma (PFP), with and
without spiking of FITC beads, by FCM (Apogee
A60-Micro). We triggered either on side scatter or
fluorescence.
Results: For scatter triggering with our FCM, swarm
detection consistently occurred for plasma samples
exceeding a (total particle) count rate of 4,100–4,200
events/s. The CD61+ EVs concentration scaled linearly
over 1.5 orders of magnitude of the dilution and most
donors required >1000-fold dilution to avoid swarm
detection, thereby reducing CD61+ EV counts. For
fluorescence triggering, the CD61+ EVs concentration
scaled linearly over >3 orders of magnitude of the
dilution. For all donors, swarm detection was absent
after 32-fold dilution (relative to pure plasma). The
count rates of CD61+ EVs were 30–100-fold higher
compared to scatter triggering. The spiked FITC
beads confirmed that the median signals remained
constant.
Summary/Conclusion: We have developed two clini-
cally applicable ways to avoid swarm detection. For
scatter triggering, the count rate provides direct feed-
back on the presence of swarm detection in plasma
samples. For fluorescence triggering, swarm detection
was absent for all plasma samples diluted ≥32-fold and
compared to scatter triggering, count rates of CD61
+ EVs were 30–100 fold higher, thereby improving
statistical significance.

Introduction: Despite flow cytometry being widely
used to analyse cells in suspension, most commercial
instruments lack sensitivity when measuring nanopar-
ticles
(NPs)
and
extracellular
vesicles
(EVs).
Furthermore, the use of appropriate reference materials
(RMs) for calibration and quality control are essential
to compare results acquired with different instruments.
To work towards successful clinical applications for EV
biomarker profiling, benchmarking studies including
state-of-the-art flow cytometers are required. We here
investigated the ability of three different flow cyt-
ometers to detect NPs and EVs.

Methods: The instrument sensitivity of light scattering
detection was evaluated by using synthetic NPs of
different sizes and refractive indices. Fluorescent cali-
bration was investigated by using molecules of equiva-
lent soluble fluorophores (MESF) beads. Biological
recombinant EVs (rEVs) were used to validate the
detection and quantification of fluorescent EVs in a
side-by-side
cross-platform
study
using
an
N30
Nanoflow Analyser (NanoFCM), an optimized BD
Influx and a CytoFLEX LX.
Results: We found that when light scatter based detec-
tion was used, the NanoFCM detected the smallest
non-fluorescent NPs, the BD Influx was able to provide
reliable FSC information from the smallest detected
NPs and the CytoFLEX performance was greatly
improved by the use of Violet-SSC. Biological rEVs
showed that the NanoFCM could clearly resolve fluor-
escent EVs while the BD Influx and CytoFLEX were
unable
to
fully
resolve
rEVs
from
background,
although fluorescence threshold improved detection.
In addition, our findings revealed that different con-
centrations are required to ensure single EV detection
in these platforms.
Summary/Conclusion: We identified several strengths
and limitations for each platform with respect to single
EV analysis. Furthermore, our results showed that proper
calibration and RMs are of utmost importance to ensure
reliable interpretation of EV flow cytometric data.

Caution when using membrane dyes for sequential extracellular vesicle
analysis
Diana Pham, Michael Wong, Desmond Pink and John lewis
Nanostics, Edmonton, Canada
Introduction: Confirmation that particles detected by
microflow cytometry are actually extracellular vesicles
(EVs), or at least membranous in composition, can be
achieved through a variety of methods. Positively stain-
ing particles with a membrane dye strongly suggest that
the particle contains a membrane; loss of stain (or
detection) after detergent solubilization of the mem-
brane-dyed particles provides even stronger evidence
that the particles were EVs. It is important to recognize
that the labelling protocol provided by the membrane
dye manufacturer may not be ideal for all types of EV-
containing biological samples, such as blood, urine,
semen etc.). Removal of excess dye from stained EVs is
very difficult and can be impractical depending on the
nature of the experiment. However, this means that the
potential for excess dye to contaminate subsequent sam-
pling is high. Therefore, it is important to determine
optimal working concentrations and labelling conditions
when using membrane dyes for EV detection to under-
stand properties that may impact your analyses.
Methods: To assess the utility of membrane dyes, titra-
tion curves were generated to determine the optimal
working concentrations of membrane dyes for EV
detection in conditioned media and human serum
samples. Once the optimal concentration was deter-
mined the potential of dye carry-over from sample to
sample during microflow cytometry detection was eval-
uated by tracking dye positive (dye+) particles in phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) blanks and matched,
unlabelled, sample replicates.
Results: We found that optimal concentration of any
membrane dye is dependent on sample type. Even with
the inclusion of system washes to prevent sample carry-
over, there was carryover of low amounts of dye+ particles
into sequentially analysed PBS blanks. If unstained samples
were analysed following a stained sample, excess dye (or at
least dye+ events) appeared in the data. A sample concen-
tration effect was also seen; samples of lower concentra-
tions were more susceptible to dye carryover.
Summary/Conclusion: When using membrane dyes to
stain EVs in biological samples, especially if an auto-
sampler is employed to run a series of tests, it is critical
to determine the optimal concentration of dye for each
type of sample, as excess dye can carry over to the next
sample in the queue. In addition, determining the
necessary steps to clean any excess dye following each
sample run will improve the accuracy of EV detection
and analyses.

Introduction: Exosomes are biological nanoparticles
released by all types of cells, healthy as well as cancer
cells. By travelling in body fluids (blood, saliva, etc.)
exosomes carry proteins and genetic cargo between cells
in distant organs. Therefore, they are involved in inter-
cellular communication and play an important role in the
development of several diseases, such as cancer. For diag-
nostic and therapeutic purposes, it is fundamental to
measure the size and the molecular content of exosomes.
Nevertheless, a direct correlation between these two
quantities at the single-exosome level has remained elu-
sive mainly due to their small size (~30-200 nm) and
their biological/soft and heterogeneous nature.
Methods: In this work, we overcome the challenges in
correlative measurements by combining two powerful
techniques:
atomic-force
(AFM)
and
fluorescence
microscopy. AFM allows accurate size-measurement
of exosomes in liquid, thus preventing their damage.
On the other hand, fluorescence microscopy is used to
estimate the amount of surface proteins/markers of
exosomes attached on a glass substrate.
Results: Exosomes from HEK293 cell line were first
bound onto patterned glass coverslips in a cell containing
1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Surface proteins of such
exosomes could be labelled with antibodies or alterna-
tively by bioengineering. The AFM, mounted on top of
the fluorescence microscope and aligned with the optical
axis, allowed combined size-fluorescence measurements
on individual exosomes. In particular, to prevent size/
shape alteration of the soft nanoparticles, force curve-
based (or quantitative) imaging was performed in liquid
environment. The correlation data was acquired for dif-
ferent samples/surface proteins/markers.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, we have mea-
sured the size and the protein expression level of single
exosomes by combining AFM and fluorescence micro-
scopy. This approach, first of its kind for exosomes,
allows to accurately estimate both properties at the
single-exosome level, thus giving valuable information
for diagnostic and therapeutic use of these nanoparti-
cles, as well as for their fundamental knowledge.

Development of a panel of antibodies for capture and labelling of EVs
from neural cell types
Kristin Luther and George Daaboul
NanoView Biosciences, Boston, USA
Introduction: There are no universal markers of
extracellular vesicles, but often they are identified by
the presence of tetraspanins in their membrane. Based
on this, products have been developed to precipitate
or quantify EVs by acting upon CD9, CD81, and
CD63. However, EVs also carry proteins from their
parent cells, and capturing EVs based their presence
allows for a more complete understanding of vesicle
heterogeneity from a single cell type, and for EVs
derived from specific tissues to be enriched from
other biofluids in support of biomarker assessment.
For example, EVs derived from the brain could be
captured from the general population of serum EVs
for better assessment of cargo associated with protei-
nopathy. The goal of this study was to identify specific
antibodies to capture and label EVs bearing the neural
markers CD171, SNAP25, α-Synuclein, Tau, and
NCAM.
Methods: The targets were overexpressed in HEK293 T
cells
through
transient
transfection
of
plasmids
(Origene). Media was conditioned for 24–48 hours,
and then centrifuged to remove cell debris. Cell lysates
and concentrated conditioned media (CM) were ana-
lysed by Western blot. Unpurified CM, or CM after
performing
size
exclusion
chromatography
(SEC,
Izon), were analysed in the ExoView R100 system.
Diluted CM was incubated on custom antibody micro-
array chips overnight. Then the chips were labelled
with a cocktail of 3 labelled antibodies, washed and
imaged. Vesicles were counted, sized, and phenotyped.
Next, commercially available pooled human CSF was
analysed in a similar fashion to determine their abun-
dance in a relevant biofluid.
Results: Multiple antibody clones were tested in dif-
ferent combinations for capture and labelling for the
five different neuronal enriched proteins of interest,
and optimal combinations were identified. Some mar-
kers were identified on particles > 50 nm in size that
were negative for tetraspanins, while others coloca-
lized with tetraspanins. Through comparing permea-
bilized and intact EVs with and without SEC to
remove non-vesicular proteins, we found that tau
could be on the vesicle surface, within the vesicle,
and free in solution.
Summary/Conclusion:
The
ExoView
platform
can be customized to enable the detection of pro-
teins of interest and to determine whether they are
on
the
EV
surface,
intravesicular,
or
non-EV
associated.

risk markers for cardiovascular disease

Introduction: Elevated numbers of circulating extracel-
lular vesicles (cEVs) have been observed in different dis-
eases, most notably cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). EVs
are reported to have thrombogenic properties, but there is
very little information about the association between
circulating EV numbers and thrombogenic risk markers
for CVD. The aim of this research was to investigate
whether thrombogenic risk markers for CVD are asso-
ciated with increased numbers of circulating EVs.
Methods: Forty non-smoking male and female subjects
(40–70y) at moderate risk for CVD were recruited for
the study. EVs from platelet-free plasma (PFP) were
isolated using size exclusion chromatography (SEC).
The concentration and size distribution of EVs were
measured by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)
and flow cytometry (FCM). Three EV markers, includ-
ing Annexin V for the circulating phosphatidylserine-
positive (PS+) EVs, CD41 for platelet-derived EVs and
CD105 for endothelial-derived EVs were used for phe-
notyping. In addition, coagulation and fibrinolysis
were assessed using a thrombodynamics analyser
(Hemacore). Platelet aggregation to determine platelet
function was assessed by a high-throughput platelet
function assay with a wide range of concentrations of
agonists, including adenine diphosphate (ADP), col-
lagen-related peptides (CRP-XL), epinephrine, throm-
bin receptor activating peptide (TRAP-6) and U46619.
The association between thrombogenic risk markers
for CVD and EV numbers was tested by Pearson’s
correlation coefficient and linear regression model
using the statistical program, SPSS.
Results: Circulating EV concentration with threshold
of 71 nm, measured by NTA, were positively associated
with coagulation-related risk markers, including rate of
clot growth (r = 0.568; p = 0.01) and clot size at 30 min
(r = 0.480; p = 0.002). PS+ EVs derived from
endothelial cells, determined by FCM, were negatively
associated with lysis onset time (r = −0.410; p = 0.009),
whereas they were found positively correlated with lysis
progression (r = 0.417; p = 0.007). Both mean and
mode size of cEVs, detected by NTA, were significantly
correlated with U46619-induced platelet aggregation
(r = −0.338; p = 0.033, r = −0.382; p = 0.015,
respectively).
Summary/Conclusion: In subjects at moderate risk for
CVD, cEV numbers were positively related to rate of
clot growth and clot size and size of cEVs was nega-
tively related to platelet activity. Higher numbers of
endothelial cell-derived PS+ cEVs were associated
with lower rates of fibrinolysis. This suggests that
cEVs promote clot growth and reduce fibrinolysis,
and may therefore be an indicator for greater risk
of CVD.

Beyond stem cells: extracellular vesicles from human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSC) and hiPSC-cardiomyocytes as therapeutic approaches
for heart failure

Introduction: Heart failure is caused by a variety of
underlying diseases, the most common being myocar-
dial infarction. Initially regarded as an alternative to
pharmacological approaches, stem cell transplantation
has failed to demonstrate clinically meaningful results.
Instead, it has become increasingly apparent that the
therapeutic effects of transplanted cells are largely
mediated by their secretome, while mounting evidence
suggests Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) play a major role
in cardiac repair. Within this framework, EVs from
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and
hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), hold a
tremendous potential to treat cardiovascular disease.

We isolated EVs from conditioned culture media at key
stages of the hiPSC-CM differentiation and maturation
processes, i.e. from hiPSC (hiPSC-EV), cardiac pro-
genitors (CPC-EV), immature (CMi-EV) and mature
(CMm-EV) cardiomyocytes, with the aim of studying
their potential role as therapeutics, and whether their
effectiveness was influenced by the state of their parent
cell.
Methods: hiPSC were differentiated into cardiomyo-
cytes in a 3D culture approach, using the protocols
developed by our group. EV isolation was performed
on an iodixanol density gradient, and the EVs were
characterized in terms of particle size and particle size
distribution, presence of EV-specific markers, and ima-
ging
through
transmission
electron
microscopy.
Functional studies were performed using human umbi-
lical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to evaluate EV-
uptake, cell migration and angiogenesis.
Results: EVs from all hiPSC and cardiac derivatives
presented
a
typical
cup-shaped
morphology
and
expressed CD63 and CD81. EV yield varied along dif-
ferentiation, with a minimum for CPC and a maximum
for CMi. PKH26-labelled EVs were uptake by HUVECs,
and colocalized with calnexin, a protein from the endo-
plasmic reticulum. Wound healing assays showed an
increased cell migration in HUVECs treated with cardi-
omyocyte-derived EVs, in comparison with control EVs
isolated from foetal bovine serum.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings suggest a different
EV secretion profile along CM differentiation and
maturation, with preliminary assays showing EV func-
tionality. Ongoing work aims at elucidating the possi-
ble differences in function and cargo amongst these
types of EVs.

Introduction: Endothelial cells (EC) are a major secre-
tory organ that selectively release biologically active
molecules. Given that extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived
miRNAs mediate cell-cell communication and serve as
biomarkers, we hypothesized that they are secreted in a
polarized manner in steady and activated states.
Methods: Primary human aortic endothelial cells and
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
cultured in transwells (± apical IL-1β, 10 ng/ml, 4 h).
Apical and basolateral EVs were isolated from super-
natants by polyethylene glycol precipitation (ExoQuick-
TC, System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA). EV-
miRNA profiles were determined by next generation
sequencing (HTG Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Tucson,
AZ, USA) and differential expression evaluated using
Partek Genomics Suite software (version 8.0). EC barrier
function was assessed by FITC-dextran flux (40 kDA)
and localization of VE-cadherin expression (MAB9381,
R&D
Systems).
Directional
miRNA
transfer
was
assessed in miR-39-transfected HUVECs by seeding
onto transwells with monocytes (THP-1 cells, apical
and basolateral compartment, 24 h).
Results: EV isolation was confirmed with nanoparticle
tracking analysis (130 nm ±19.57, n = 12) and protein
content-based characterization (CD63 positive, Calnexin
negative). EV size and concentration was unaffected by
IL-1β. IL-1β-stimulated ECs demonstrated a 1.89 ± 0.098
fold change in FITC permeability (p < 0.0001, n = 3), but
VE-Cadherin expression was maintained at adherens
junctions (n = 2). Sequencing performed on EC-EVs
isolated from each compartment showed differential
miRNA expression (p < 0.05, fold change >1.5; n = 7).
Polarized EV-miRNA secretion was maintained after IL-
1β stimulation but demonstrated altered miRNA profiles.
Selective and directional release of EV-miRNA was
demonstrated in a model of cellular communication,
whereby ECs transfected with exogenous miRNA-39 pre-
ferentially deliver this to monocytes in the apical com-
partment (274 ± 163 fold increase, n = 2).
Summary/Conclusion: ECs selectively secrete EV-
miRNA in a polarized fashion and may therefore par-
ticipate in selective and directional cell-cell communi-
cation. These findings have important implications for
discovery
of
EV-miRNA
based
biomarkers
and
therapeutics.

Introduction: Annexin A1 associates with extracellular
vesicles (EVs) and can mediate vesicle aggregation.
This may play a role in microcalcification in calcific
aortic valve disease (CAVD), but this is poorly under-
stood. Annexin A1 is thought to be a marker of mem-
brane-derived EVs, but because it can be found on the
cytoplasmic or extracellular side of the plasma mem-
brane, its localization within or on the surface of EVs is
unclear. The goal of this study was to determine
whether annexin A1 is found on the surface of EVs
in two cell lines relevant to CAVD, and develop an
assay that can be used to determine whether this
changes under pathogenic conditions.
Methods: EVs were isolated by differential ultracentri-
fugation from the conditioned medium (CM) of
smooth muscle cells (SMC) and valvular interstitial
cells (VIC). Total protein in the cell lysates and EV
pellets was analysed by western blot. EVs from cells
treated with control siRNA or Anxa1-siRNA were
enumerated and phenotyped using the ExoView R100
platform. EVs with surface expression of CD9, CD81,
CD63, and annexin A1 were captured using a custo-
mized antibody microarray chip. Then EVs were
labelled with fluorescent antibodies to assess EV num-
ber, size, and colocalization of EV proteins. The knock-
down of annexin A1 allowed us to assess the specificity
of the selected annexin A1 antibody.
Results: The EV fraction was positive for CD9, and
lacked markers of other vesicle types. Western blot on
the EV pellet and supernatant in ± EDTA indicated
that there is annexin A1 both on the surface of and
within the EVs. Using the antibody microarray chips,
numerous annexin A1+ EVs were captured on the
annexin A1 spots from the control CM, and there
was a marked decrease in capture and labelling from
Anxa1-siRNA treated cells. Under both conditions,
vesicles were also captured on tetraspanin probes,
with the greatest number captured on CD9, then
CD63 and CD81. There was a significant population
of annexin A1+ EVs that was negative for tetraspanins.
Summary/Conclusion: Annexin A1 is found on the
surface of EVs. The assay developed in collaboration
with NanoView Biosciences is well suited for assessing
the number and phenotype of annexin A1+ EVs
derived from SMC and VIC cell lines, which could
provide a useful method for understanding EV popula-
tions in CAVD patient cell lines.

Introduction:
Chronic
limb-threatening
ischaemia
(CLTI), the end stage of peripheral artery disease
(PAD), has poor prognosis and is attributed to life-
style disease. With increasing of atherosclerotic disease
all over the world, establishment of biomarker for
should play a pivotal role for early detection and pre-
venting aggravation of the disease. The aim of this
study is to explore the possibility of liquid biopsy for
atherosclerotic disease by analysis of CLTI-associated
exosomal microRNAs.
Methods: CLTI due to PAD was diagnosed by ankle-
brachial blood pressure index, skin perfusion pressure
(<40 mmHg) and angiography. Ten preoperative CLTI
patients and 10 control patients without PAD were
analysed (All patients with diabetes and 50% of patients
had end-stage renal failure [ESRD]). To identify bio-
markers
associated
with
CLTI,
exosomes
were
extracted from patient’s serum after ultracentrifugation
and total RNA including small RNA was isolated from
the exosomes. The expression profile of exosomal
microRNAs associated with CLTI were evaluated
using a next generation sequencing.
Results: Forty-three exosomal miRNAs associated with
CLTI were identified. Intriguingly, these miRNAs were
clearly categorized with ESRD, which was well known
as end-stage of life-style disease: these were stratified
into
20
microRNAs
for
ESRD
patients
and
23
microRNAs for non-ESRD patients. Since ESRD is
the most important factor significantly related to
patient’s prognosis in CLTI, exosomal microRNAs
reflected patient’s comorbidity onto the expression
profile.
Summary/Conclusion: A portion of the expression
profile of exosomal microRNAs associated with CLTI
was identified. Exosomal microRNA could be a bio-
marker to stratify patient’s condition along with their
comorbidities and is very promising for individualized
diagnosis
in
atherosclerotic
diseases
with
risk
diversity.

Introduction: Patients with mitral valve regurgitation
(MR) show volume overload and progressive heart
remodelling with increased left ventricular (LV) end-
diastolic volume (EDV). Surgery is recommended for
patients with substantial decay of global cardiac func-
tion (LV ejection fraction, LVEF) in order to reverse
LV remodelling. However, approximately 10% patients
show poor recovery. Identification of patients at high
risk of post-operative LV remodelling may help pre-
ventive strategies. In this scenario, microRNAs deliv-
ered by plasma exosomes (pEXOs) might have a
predictive value as well as complement the routine
clinical measures of surgical outcome.
Methods: Primary MR patients (N = 19; 45–71 y.o.)
underwent implantation of a prosthetic mitral ring. LV
remodelling was assessed by cardiac magnetic reso-
nance imaging and pEXOs were isolated by optimized
ultracentrifugation before surgery (T0) and six months
after surgery (T1). Isolated pEXOs were quantified by
nanoparticle tracking analysis and miR-1, miR-21,
miR-133a, and miR-208a were measured by RT-
qPCR. The same analysis was performed on healthy
subjects with normal cardiac function (N = 8). Local
ethical committee approved the study (EMIGRATE
study, approval n°1529) and informed consent was
obtained from all patients.
Results: pEXOs levels at T0 were lower (−32%,
p = 0.02) in patients with worst postoperative LV
function,
while
they
were
higher
at
T1
(+31%,
p = 0.03) in patients with reversed LV remodelling
after surgery. At T1, the increase in pEXOs levels was
associated to decreased heart mass index (−13%,
p = 0.02) and higher levels of exosomal miR-21
(+78%, p = 0.02) and miR-133a (+69%, p = 0.05)
were detected in patients with improved LV function.
Summary/Conclusion: Higher postoperative levels
of pEXOs delivering miR-21 and 133a depict LV
reverse
remodelling
after
surgical
mitral
valve
repair. Monitoring of exosomal microRNAs cargo
might predict postoperative outcome in patients
with MR.

Introduction: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the
most prevalent cardiovascular condition globally and it
is estimated to increase greatly with the ageing of the
population. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged
as potential components of liquid biopsy related to
their protein and nucleic acid cargo. The transcrip-
tomic analysis of circulating EVs has revealed the
expression of genes related to the immune response
in PAD, including lipocalin-2 (LCN2) or NGAL,
which has been involved in atherogenesis in preclinical
studies.
Methods: To study if the content of circulating EVs
might reflect molecular changes locally, LCN2 levels
were determined by RT-qPCR in femoral atherosclero-
tic plaques (n = 5) and in medium/large EVs released
from femoral plaques into cell culture medium ex vivo
(n
=
5).
EVs
were
isolated
by
centrifugation
(2x20000xg) and characterized by NTA, TEM, and
western
blot.
The
study
was
approved
by
the
Institutional Review Board of Complejo Hospitalario
de Navarra (ref. 30/10), according to the Declaration of
Helsinki on medical research. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients.
Results: LCN2 mRNA was detected in femoral plaques
and in tissue derived EVs by RT-qPCR. Additional
PCR experiments in plaque derived EVs showed the
presence of the LCN2 full length transcript within EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: The transcriptional content of
plasma EVs (liquid biopsy) might reflect in part the
molecular changes within atherosclerotic tissue, and
femoral plaque derived EVs.

Introduction: Myocardial is a significant cause of mor-
tality and morbidity in developed countries and since
current therapies are only palliative this pathology has
arisen in the last decade. Mesenchymal stromal cell
(MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerged as
potential therapeutic element to reduce tissue damage
after the ischaemic insult. EVs are known to recapitu-
late healing benefits exert by MSC transplantation in
preclinical ischaemic models but EV based therapies
face relevant difficulties such as high effective dose and
manufacturing standardization. In this piece of work,
we immortalized EV secreting MSCs to get high
amount of EVs from a standizable and scalable source.
Methods: MSC were immortalized and secreted EVs
(EVMSC-I) isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation.
In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of
EVMSC-I we used both human and rat cardiomyocytes
as well as cardiac microvascular cultures subjected to
isquemia/reperfusion injury. We evaluated the capacity
of EVMSC-I to reduce the consequences of the ischae-
mic insult measuring cell viability and functional para-
meters like contractile capacity in the cardiomyocytes
and angiogenic properties in the cardiac microvascular
cultures. EVMSC-I therapeutic effect was assessed in
vivo in a rat model of cardiac infarction followed by
histopathological studies.
Results: EVMSC-I significantly reduced cardiomyo-
cyte death (22%±7.219%) and revert the beating rate
reduction in a 45%±17.31% trigger by the ischaemic
event. In this regard, EVMSC-I inhibit caspase 3 clea-
vage and reduce the appearance of ROS. In terms of
post-ischaemic neoangiogenesis, we observed that
EVMSC-I increased the capacity of vascular cells to
form tubular structures. In addition, we observed that
EVMSC-I reduce the consequences of cardiac infarc-
tion in vivo. Finally, intramuscular injection of
EVMSC-I after permanent ligation of the descendent
coronary reduced the infarct area in rats from 46%
±10.98% of the left ventricular area in control group
to a 31.27%±8.619% in the group treated with
EVMSC-I
Summary/Conclusion: Taking all together, our results
show that EVMSC-I mitigate the consequences of the
cardiac infarction by reducing tissue damage. More
work needs to be done to understand the underlying
biological processes.

Introduction: Clinically, the drug resistance situation
of Acinetobacter baumannii is becoming increasingly
serious, and its drug resistance has become a difficult
problem for nosocomial infection and clinical treat-
ment. In view of the relatively slow development of
antibacterial drugs, exploring the resistance mechanism
of Acinetobacter baumannii is of great significance to
improve bacterial resistance and help clinical treat-
ment. Studies have shown that outer membrane vesi-
cles (OMVs) can transmit resistance genes to mediate
the spread of drug resistance, and recent studies have
confirmed that high expression of efflux pumps play an
important role in the multidrug resistance of A. bau-
mannii. In this study, we want to explore whether the
outer membrane vesicles of Acinetobacter baumannii
can transfer the efflux pump related substances.
Methods: First, ultracentrifugation and density gradi-
ent centrifugation were used to extract the OMVs of
Acinetobacter
baumannii
antimicrobial-sensitive
strains
(ATCC19606)
and
antimicrobial-resistant
strains. Then, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
technology was used to analyse the particle size and
distribution range of OMVs. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was used to identify their morphol-
ogy and structure. Bradford method was used to deter-
mine the protein concentration of OMVs. Next, the
OMVs of antimicrobial-resistant strains were incu-
bated with the antimicrobial-sensitive strains and then
the drug susceptibility test was done to determine
whether
OMVs
of
antimicrobial-resistant
strains
could transmit antimicrobial-resistance information to
the antimicrobial-sensitive strains. Finally, PCR, qPCR
and
mass
spectrometry
were
used
to
determine
whether the efflux pump related genes were higher
expression in OMVs of antimicrobial-resistant strains
than those in antimicrobial-sensitive strains.
Results: Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) detected
the concentration and size distribution of OMVs of
Acinetobacter baumannii strains. It showed that the
extracted OMVs have a relatively uniform particle
size and a size between 100–250 nm. TEM showed
that OMVs had a typical vesicle structure. OMVs co-
culture experiments showed that OMVs of the antimi-
crobial-resistant strains can indeed pass resistance to
the antimicrobial-sensitive strains. And the efflux
pump related genes were higher expression in OMVs
of antimicrobial-resistant strains than those in antimi-
crobial-sensitive strains.
Summary/Conclusion: OMVs of the antimicrobial-
resistant strains can indeed pass resistance to the anti-
microbial-sensitive strains. The cause of acquiring anti-
microbial resistance in sensitive strains may be caused
by resistant strains passing efflux pump-related genes
or proteins to sensitive strains.

Introduction: The choroid is located at the backside of
the light-sensitive retina and is highly vascularized. It
contains pigmented melanocytes, and their melanin
protects them against oxidative stress. Since ageing
reduces the number of melanosomes in melanocytes
and generates a stiffer extracellular environment, our
hypothesis is that surrounding choroidal cells and the
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are subject to more
oxidative stress-related damages. This study aimed to
characterize EVs released by human choroidal melano-
cytes in the context of intercellular cooperation during
ocular ageing.

Methods: Melanocytic EVs were recovered from the
conditioned culture medium of young/old melanocytes
grown on hydrogels of varying stiffness (0.5–20 kPa) by
differential centrifugation. The concentration and size
distribution of melanocytic EVs were determined by
high-sensitivity
flow
cytometry.
Cryo-transmission
electron microscopy combined with receptor-specific
gold labelling were used to reveal their morphology,
size and phenotype. The relative abundance of 8 sur-
face markers was evaluated with
the Exo-Check
Exosome Antibody Array. The uptake of fluorescent
melanocytic EVs by the RPE and choroidal endothelial
cells was assessed by confocal microscopy.
Results: Choroidal melanocytes released EVs positive
for Annexin-5 and the tetraspanin CD63. Young mel-
anocytes produced more Annexin-5 positive EVs and
EVs larger than 500 nm compared to older donors. The
stromal stiffness impacted the concentration and size
of melanocytic EVs. We confirmed the uptake of mel-
anocytic EVs by endothelial and RPE cells.
Summary/Conclusion: EVs from choroidal melano-
cytes are internalized by surrounding endothelial cells
and RPE. Age-related stressors modify the phenotype
of melanocytic EVs. The identification of melanocytic
factors that can protect retina/choroid cells from oxi-
dative stress-induced cell death could lead to more
efficient therapy for patients suffering from dry age-
related macular degeneration.

Introduction: Owing to their proposed biocompatibil-
ity and ability to cross biological barriers, EVs repre-
sent
an
attractive
therapeutic
delivery
platform.
However, EVs are eminently heterogeneous. A better
understanding of EV heterogeneity and its origins will
allow for improved design of EV-based therapeutics.
EV heterogeneity is mainly studied by focusing on
distinct
EV
subpopulations.
Other
sources
of
heterogeneity, such as heterogeneity within EV secret-
ing cells themselves, have been investigated in lesser
detail. In this study, we assessed the phenotypic drift of
cell derived EVs to explore the origins of EV hetero-
geneity and its potential impact.
Methods: Three independent samples of two MDA-
MB-231 breast cancer cell sub-clones were cultured
for six weeks. EVs were harvested weekly and analysed
using the MACSplex Exosome Flow Cytometry kit. At
two time points the proteome of EVs was analysed by
LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry with subsequent Gene
Ontology and REACTOME Pathway Analysis.
Results: The expression of over 600 proteins was de-
regulated in EVs derived from the two different cell
clones. Many de-regulated proteins were associated
with biological processes predicted to affect potential
EV toxicity (platelet activation, neutrophil degranula-
tion, blood coagulation) and EV biological activity
(antigen
presentation,
inflammation,
TGF-beta/
mTOR/WNT signalling). More surprisingly, within
only two weeks, over 400 EV proteins, many associated
with
immune
modulation,
apoptosis,
interleukins,
cytokines and cell signalling pathways (including
those affecting T-cell/B-cell receptors) were de-regu-
lated between the two EV isolation time points.
Summary/Conclusion: Results suggest that temporal
changes can be observed in the EV proteome (poten-
tially by clonal drift, epigenetic changes or cellular
genomic instability) over short time periods. These
changes could cause significant differences in biological
effects and delivery capabilities between EVs harvested
from the same cells at different time points and
conditions.

radiation damage. In this study, we evaluated the bio-
distribution of MSC-EVs in a radiated mouse model.
Methods: Human MSC-EVs were harvested by ultra-
centrifugation and labelled with DiD lipid dye. The
reliability of the labelling EVs was confirmed by
sucrose gradient fractionation analysis. The distribu-
tion of EVs in radiation-exposed mice after EV intra-
venous administration were evaluated by Fluorescence
Molecular Tomography and further confirmed by flow
cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis.
Results: We observed that DiD labelled MSC-EVs
appeared highest in liver and spleen, lower in bone
marrow in tibias, femurs, and spine, and were unde-
tectable in heart, kidney and lung. We found the sig-
nificantly increased MSC-EV accumulation in spleen
and bone marrow post-radiation appeared with an
increase of uptake of MSC-EV by CD11b+ and F4/80
+ cells, but not B220+ cells, compared to those organs
from non-irradiated mice. However, there was a pre-
dominant EV accumulation in lung and less accumula-
tion in spleen and liver; in mice infused with human
lung fibroblast cell derived EVs (LFC-EVs) and there
was no significant LFC-EVs accumulation change in
the spleen or liver after radiation. We further found
that increasing levels of irradiation caused a selective
increase in vesicle homing to marrow and spleen. This
accumulation of MSC-EVs at the site of injured bone
marrow could be detected as early as 1 hour after MSC-
EV
injection
and
was
not
significantly
different
between 2 and 24 hrs. post-MSC-EV injection.

fic accumulation of MS-EVs at the site of injury of
haematopoietic tissue in radiation injury mice.

Linking fat to colorectal cancer: extracellular vesicle crosstalk
Robert Tempest, Daniel Kelly, Caroline Dalton and Nicholas Peake
Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK
Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the third most com-
mon cancer worldwide, and fourth leading cause of
malignancy
related
mortality.
Understanding
the
mechanisms of its growth and metastasis is key to elu-
cidating new therapeutic targets and developing treat-
ments in the clinical setting. Epidemiological evidence
indicates an increased risk of cancer in obese patients,
pointing to bidirectional communication between colon
and adipose cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small
membrane enclosed packages released by cells, capable
of transporting bioactive cargo from donor to recipient
cells and inducing phenotypic changes. Adipocytes are a
key component of the tumour microenvironment and
interactions between adipose tissue and tumour cells
may be important in the growth and metastasis of
cancer. In this study, we investigate the effects of color-
ectal cancer EVs on adipocytes in vitro, and potential
induction of dedifferentiation to a more fibroblastic,
pro-inflammatory phenotype.
Methods: EVs were isolated from SW480 and HT29
human colorectal cancer cell lines by differential ultra-
centrifugation and mature adipocytes generated by dif-
ferentiation of the SGBS human pre-adipocyte cell line.
Adipocytes were treated with EVs and their lipid con-
tent measured by oil red O to determine loss of lipids.
Inflammatory cytokine profile was measured by ELISA
to assess any increase in pro-inflammatory behaviour,
and expression of late adipogenesis markers were
determined by western blot.
Results: EV treatment was shown to reduce lipid accu-
mulation in adipocytes, with up to 80% reduction in
lipids observed at the 50 µg/mL dose. Treatment was
also shown to reduce the expression of late adipogen-
esis markers, and increase secreted levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 by over 3 fold
and 10 fold respectively. These results provide evidence
for colorectal cancer derived EV involvement in the
dedifferentiation observed in cancer associated adipo-
cytes in vivo, displaying an altered phenotype, releasing
lipid energy stores to fuel tumour growth and increas-
ing pro-inflammatory signalling.
Summary/Conclusion: Studies have shown colorectal
cancer EVs may be involved in signalling which
induces functional changes in cells within the tumour
microenvironment.
Our
work
indicates
that
EV
mediated dedifferentiation of resident adipocytes may
potentially contribute to a microenvironment favour-
ing cancer cell growth and metastasis. Further work
aims to elucidate the specific EV cargo which mediates
these effects.

Introduction: Ageing is a major risk factor for many
human diseases. It is a complex process that progres-
sively compromises most of the biological functions of
the organisms, resulting in an increased susceptibility
to disease and death. Senescence is a cellular phenotype
characterized by a stable cell cycle arrest. Senescent
cells are accumulated in the body during ageing. It
contributes to develop age-related diseases and cancer.
The alteration in intercellular communication with age
has been demonstrated to be due to senescent cells
developing a phenomenon denominated senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Exosomes are
small extracellular vesicles (sEV) (30–120 nm) of endo-
cytic origin whereas microvesicles are formed by shed-
ding of the plasma membrane. They contain nucleic
acids, proteins and lipid that generally reflect the status
of the parental cell and can influence the behaviour of
neighbouring cells.
Methods: In this study, we demonstrated that the small
extracellular vesicles (sEV) contribute for transmitting
paracrine senescence to proliferative cells Firstly, we
evaluated the presence of exosome-like particles in
the sEV from senescent cells by detection of exosome
markers

from senescent cells are mediators of the paracrine
senescence, we performed functional assays using

Results: Besides, we confirmed at a single-cell level that
the proliferative cells internalizing sEV from senescent
cells activate senescence process using the Cre-reporter
system. sEV protein analysis from senescent cells by
mass spectrometry (MS) and validation of top candi-

(IFITM3), a component of non-canonical interferon

senescence to proliferative cells.

sEV
are
regulators
of
paracrine
senescence
and
IFITM3 contained in senescent sEV has an important
role in the intercellular communication mediated
through sEV during cellular senescence1.

Introduction: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling
and stiffening are associated with solid tumour pro-
gression. Stiff ECM promotes cell proliferation, epithe-
lial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis and
chemoresistance.
Hepatocellular
carcinoma
(HCC)
appears frequently in patients with liver cirrhosis or
fibrosis
while
the
mechanism
remains
unclear.
Exosomes have been determined to serve as messengers
to mediate intercellular communication and influence
the extracellular. Tumour-derived exosomes have been
shown to influence tumour progression, metastasis,
drug resistance, angiogenesis and immune regulation.
Thus,
determining
whether
exosomes
provide
a
mechanism by which stiff matrix modulates tumour
microenvironment for tumour progression opens a
new way to understand cirrhosis and oncogenesis.
Here we identified the molecular mechanism of matrix
stiffening induced exosome secretion and showed the
different effect of exosomes induced by soft or stiff
matrix on tumorigenesis.
Methods: Huh7 cells were cultured on acrylamide gels
with the stiffness was modulated to 500 Pa (soft) or
10 k Pa (stiff). The exosomes in conditioned media
were collected and analysed by nanoparticle trafficking
analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting. Protein expres-
sion level in cells was screened by Reverse Phase
Protein Array (RPPA). Inhibitor or shRNA were used
to inhibit target proteins function. In vitro phosphor-
ylation and GEF assay were used to verify Rabin8
phosphorylation and activation. Exosomes from cells
on soft or stiff matrix were injected into mice to study
their effect on tumour growth.
Results:
(1) Stiff matrix promoted exosomes secretion.
(2) Akt was activated by stiff matrix and was
required for exosome secretion.
(3) Rab8 was activated by Akt and regulated exo-
some secretion.
(4) Rabin8 was a direct target of Akt.
(5) Stiff exosomes promote tumour growth.

Introduction: The extracellular matrix (ECM) is con-
stituted of a variety of proteins and polysaccharides
that are secreted locally and assembled into a thick
3D meshwork to provide biophysical and biochemical
support to the surrounding cells, and regulate numer-
ous cellular functions such as adhesion, migration and
proliferation. Dysregulation of ECM components or
aberrant ECM remodelling can lead to various pathol-
ogies, as well as to play important roles in wound
healing. Although ECM secretion pathways are still
largely unknown, the current paradigm is that ECM-
associated proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic
reticulum and transported via the endosomes to the
Golgi apparatus en route to the cell surface and
released by exocytosis.
Methods: To study ECM secretion pathway, we used 3-
dimensional (3D) cultured fibroblasts. This culture
method technique has been used widely to generate
tissue-engineered self-assembled stromal tissues, free
of exogenous materials, and rely on long-term supple-
mentation of sodium ascorbate into the culture med-
ium. Non-cancerous fibroblasts, grown in conventional
two-dimensional (2D) cellular cultures, are known to
be a poor source of secreted exosomes when compared
to cancerous fibroblasts.
Results: Here, we provide evidence that non-cancerous
dermal fibroblasts can secrete high amounts of exo-
somes, containing different ECM proteins, when culti-
vated in a 3D fashion. We also demonstrated that
dermal fibroblast-derived exosomes had the capacity
to travel from one cell to another, induce cellular
migration and promote wound healing.
Summary/Conclusion:
Altogether,
these
findings
reveal a novel exosome-dependent ECM deposition
mechanism and suggest that the use of 3D-fibroblast
cellular culture may emerge as an innovative approach
in precision medicine to better study the role of
patient-derived exosomes and ECM proteins in the
establishment of cellular microenvironment in health
and disease.

Introduction: Bionanoparticles including extracellular
vesicles and exomeres (collectively termed EVs), have
been shown to play significant roles in diseases and ther-
apeutic
applications.
However,
their
spatiotemporal
dynamics in vivo have remained largely unresolved in
detail due to the lack of a limited suitable method.
Methods: We developed a bioluminescence resonance
energy transfer (BRET)-based reporter, PalmGRET, to
enable pan-bionanoparticle labelling ranging from exo-
meres (< 50 nm) to small (< 200 nm) and medium and
large (> 200 nm) EVs and larger EVs (> 50 nm).
Results: PalmGRET emits robust, sustained signals and
allows the visualization, tracking and quantification of
bionanoparticles from whole-animal to nanoscopic
resolutions under different imaging modalities, includ-
ing bioluminescence, BRET, and fluorescence. Using
PalmGRET, we show that EVs released by lung meta-
static hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibit lung
tropism with varying distributions to other major
organs in immunocompetent mice. EV proteomics
identified HCC-EV lung tropic protein candidates
associated
with
cancer
progression,
in
which
SLCO2A1 and CLIC1 expression on non-tropic EVs
conferred lung-tropism, while CD13 gave spleen trop-
ism. Our results further demonstrate that redirected
lung tropism decreases EV distribution to the liver,
whereas the spleen tropism significantly reduces over
time delivery to most major organs distribution includ-
ing the liver and kidney.
Summary/Conclusion: We established a multimodal
and multi-resolution PalmBRET method to enable
pan-bionanoparticle labelling and imaging and there-
fore quantification in live cells, whole animals, and

preserved tissues. The method can resolve the intricate
spatiotemporal dynamics of EVs. PalmGRET revealed
that EVs derived from lung metastatic HCC are lung
tropic, and the tropism can be conferred to non-lung-
tropic EV-293 T by decorating EVs with identified
HCC-EV
membrane
proteins.
Importantly,
the
enhanced EV delivery to tropic organs also signifi-
cantly alters its distribution to other major organs.
Our findings suggest that the dynamics of EV biodis-
tribution and targeted design should be investigated at
the organ systems level in EV biology and therapeutic
developments, respectively.

Introduction: Small Extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are
nanoparticles (30–120mn) encircled by a phospholipid
bilayer, derived from the endocytic pathway and
released by all cells. sEVs have an inherent role in cell
communication and deliver cargo to target cells.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and have a natural
ability to home to tumours and metastases while avoid-
ing the host immune response. It is hypothesised that
MSC derived sEVs (MSC-sEVs) also possess tumour-
homing
and
immune-evading
capacities
therefore
could provide a novel targeted delivery vehicle for
treatment of cancer. It is imperative to elucidate
MSC-sEVs migratory itinerary in vivo to support trans-
lation to the clinical setting.
Methods: This study aimed to image the interaction of
labelled MSC-sEVs with cancer cells in real time in vivo.
sEVs were isolated from wildtype MSCs and MSCs
with stably expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)
(via
lentivirus)
by
the
combined
techniques
of
differential centrifugation, microfiltration and ultra-
centrifugation. Isolated sEVs were extensively charac-
terised by Transmission electron Microscopy (TEM),
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis and Western Blot.
NOD SCID Gamma (NSG) mice with dorsal skinfold
window chamber (DSFWC) were injected with either
MDA-MB-231 luciferase (Luc) expressing cells or HT-
29-Luc cells. Bioluminescence imaging was performed
to confirm tumour formation. A dose of 1x10^7 MSC-
RFP-sEVs was directly added to the window chamber
and RFP expression detected using a microscope with
RFP filter attachments. 8x10^7 EVs were incubated
with
the
radionuclide,
Technetium-99m
tagged
Duramycin (99 mTc-Dur) for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Excess radiolabel was removed using exo-
some spin column (Invitrogen™). The 99 mTc-Dur-
sEVs were then added directly to the window chamber
and charged particle imaging carried out.
Results: 18 hours post-administration; the RFP signal
was localised at the tumour site. Radiolabelled sEV
signal could be detected 10 minutes and 4 hours after
administration. MSC-sEVs were successfully detected
at the tumour site following direct administration
using two different tagging and imaging approaches.
Summary/Conclusion: This promising preliminary
data supports the potential of this approach for track-
ing MSC-sEV migration In Vivo. Future studies will
investigate systemic tracking of MSC-sEV migration.

Introduction: Tumor-derived small extracellular vesi-
cles (sEVs) have emerged recently as mediators of
tumorigenesis. However, the role of sEVs in response
to irradiation, a widely used therapy in prostate cancer,
is not fully understood.
Methods: Our study involved the TRAMP mouse
model of prostate cancer. We used plasma sEVs iso-
lated using differential ultra-centrifugation and further

used Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) to analyze
sEVs. Mouse pelvises were irradiated using 10 Gy, for 5
consecutive days.
Results: We first observed that upon pelvic irradia-
tion of TRAMP mice, the levels of the signaling
oncogene c-Src are reduced in plasma-derived sEVs,
while the average size of sEVs is increased from 50-
100nms to 70-250nms. Furthermore, we show that
the sEVs from irradiated cells lose the ability to
stimulate anchorage independent growth and migra-
tion of recipient cancer cells. Additionally, sEVs
from irradiated mice increase the amount of DNA
damage in recipient cancer cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, our data show that
irradiation of TRAMP mice (and prostate cancer
cells) significantly reduces the pro-metastatic and
pro-anchorage-independent
growth
potential
of
sEVs when tested on human cells. Changes to the
composition and behavior of a cancer cell sEV
population via radiation therapy offers promise for
future therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer.

Introduction: There are emerging physiological and
pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs)
in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Brain derived-EVs contain pathogenic
proteins, such as tau, amyloid beta (Aβ), which have
been reported to contribute to cell-to-cell propagation
in those diseases. Investigation of the brain-derived EV
cargo, therefore, is important to further understand the
mechanisms of progression in neurodegenerative dis-
eases. We developed the EV separation method from
unfixed frozen mouse and human brain tissues and
assessed the protein composition.
Methods: To establish the EV separation method, we
separated EVs from frozen mouse brain tissue using
sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation (SG-UC)
or size exclusion chromatography to compare the
results from the particle number, morphology and
protein profiling by NTA, TEM and Mass spectrome-
try. EVs were then separated from cortical grey matter
of AD (n = 20) and Control (n = 18) by SG-UC. Tau
and Aβ in the EVs were measured by immunoassay.
Differentially expressed EV proteins were observed by
quantitative proteomics employing machine learning.
Results: The separated EVs were enriched in EV mole-
cules and devoid of contaminant proteins by SG-UC,
showing our method was successful. The levels of
pS396 tau and Aβ1-42 were significantly increased in
AD EVs. Annexin A5 (ANXA5), neurosecretory pro-
tein VGF, neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6-a
(GPM6A),
and
Alpha-centractin
(ACTZ)
were
differentially expressed in AD EVs. A combination of
these 4 proteins were confirmed to predict AD with the
88% accuracy by machine learning.
Summary/Conclusion: These data suggest our method
were suitable for the separation of brain-derived EVs
and EV ANXA5, VGF, GPM6A and ACTZ can be
potential biomarkers for monitoring the progression
of AD.

Introduction: To establish reliable biorepositories for
research on extracellular vesicles (EVs) as disease bio-
markers, the release of EVs during blood collection and
handling must be avoided. Currently, citrate is recom-
mended as the anticoagulant for blood EV research,
but citrate does not inhibit the release of EVs from
activated platelets. The release of platelet-derived EVs
excludes pneumatic tube transport and makes assays
time dependent, thereby limiting clinical compatibility.
Therefore, we aim to stabilize the release of platelet EV
concentrations.
Methods: Blood samples were collected from healthy
individuals and subjected to common circumstances
known to induce platelet activation. Blood was (i)
incubated with or without thrombin receptor-activat-
ing peptide 6 (TRAP; n = 7), a potent platelet activator,
(ii) send to the lab by a routine blood transport

(pneumatic tube system; n = 3), and (iii) stored at
room temperature or at 4°C for 6 hours (n = 3). The
concentrations of EVs from platelets (CD61+), acti-
vated platelets (P-selectin+), erythrocytes (CD235a+),
and leukocytes (CD45+) were determined by flow cyto-
metry (Apogee A60-Micro).
Results: Following activation by TRAP, concentrations
of platelet-derived and activated platelet-derived EVs
increased 5.8-fold and 10.4-fold in citrate-anticoagu-
lated blood, compared to 1.4-fold and 2.0-fold in
EDTA-anticoagulated
blood
(EDTA
vs
citrate:
p = 0.018 and p = 0.043, respectively). Preliminary
data show that during pneumatic tube transport and
routine sample handling, both platelet- and activated
platelet-derived EVs were more stable in EDTA com-
pared to citrate. The concentrations of EVs from
erythrocytes and leukocytes were unaffected under all
studied conditions.
Summary/Conclusion: To conclude, EDTA stabilizes
platelet EV concentrations during and after blood collec-
tion, which would facilitate pneumatic tube transport,
enhance reliability and thereby improves the establish-
ment of reliable biorepositories for EV research.

Introduction: Cancer-cell secreted extracellular vesi-
cles, called exosomes, are an emerging biomarker for
cancer liquid biopsy. Profiling of cancer-associated
exosomes usually required lengthy, and multi-step pro-
cedures; therefore simple and easy-setup sensing meth-
ods are urgently needed for diagnosing cancer in a
timely manner. Chirality, the foundational property of
all biomolecules, including exosomal proteins, can be
utilized for exosome detection and differentiation using
recent advances in chiral nanostructures. We found
that microfluidic sensors can be successfully imple-
mented for successful detection of cancer-associated
exosomes taking advantage of unusually high circular
dichroism (CD) of chiral gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).
Methods:
Circular
Dichroism-based
Exosome
(CDEXO) detection utilizes chiroplasmonic enhance-
ment of CD signatures of cancer-associated exosomes.
We first synthesized donut-shaped AuNPs conjugated
with L-cysteine and immobilized the AuNPs on a glass
slide using a layer-by-layer assembly. The AuNPs on
slide glass were surface functionalized by the standard
biotin-avidin
reaction
after
MUA
treatment.
Biotinylated annexin V marker, targeting phosphatidyl-
serine (PS) expression on cancer-associated exosomes,
was conjugated to the AuNP surface. 5 μl of exosome
samples from cancer cells (A549 and H3255) or normal
cells (MRC5) were injected into the PDMS microfluidic
device and incubated for 30 minutes. The CD signal
before and after exosome exposure was monitored,
compared, and systematically analysed as a rapid tech-
nique
for
the
detection
of
exosomes
with
high
sensitivity.
Results: We showed that the CDEXO signals from
cancer exosomes showed 26.6 folds absolute CD peak
value change and 3.41 folds shift, respectively, com-
pared to that of healthy exosomes. Importantly, the
CDEXO sensing method takes less than 10 mins in
terms of total scanning time and requires minimal
sample volumes. From the preclinical studies using 7
blood samples from cancer patients and healthy
donors, we found that cancer patients show stronger
band shift and signal change comparing to that of
healthy donors, implying our platform could be used
for cancer diagnosis.
Summary/Conclusion: This new versatile and sensitive
method based on chiroplasmonic exosome detection
paves the way to profiling disease-associated exosomes
in a timely manner for minimal volumes of liquid
biopsies.

Introduction: The development of new classification
technology is required based on the evaluation of phy-
sicochemical properties of exosome surfaces and the
diversity of constituent molecules. In this presentation,
we present the electric charge activated exosome sort-
ing platform comprising microfluidic device technol-

Methods: The single nanoparticle analysis platform,
which has been developed by our research group,
images Rayleigh scattered light (elastically scattered
light) obtained by irradiating nanoparticles with con-
vergent laser light and provides information of indivi-
dual particles by image processing. The method that
utilizes electrokinetic phenomena, unlike the method
using fluorescent labels, measures the properties of the
particle surface without serious difficulty in principle
even if the particle size is on the order of tens nano-
metres, and further enables to perform fractionation.
Since the number of particles usually handled in exo-
some research or its envisioned application is enor-
mous, it is not realistic to take an approach such as a

results of individual particles.
Results: Particles receive attraction or repulsion by an
external field according to the charge density on the
surface, so there is no need to control the external
force, and it is possible to design a device that can
autonomously fractionate particles according to the
difference in zeta potential.

posed and demonstrated the new concept of electric
charge activated EV sorter.

Institute (KETI), Seoul, Republic of Korea
Introduction: Exosome is one of the important extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) released from parental cells and
it contains various types of molecular cargos from its
original
cell
including
proteins,
messenger
RNA
(mRNA), and micro RNA (miRNAs) [1]. The exo-
somes have recently emerged as biomarkers for early
stage cancer detection because the number of exosomes
originated from cancerous cells are significantly higher
than those from normal cells [2]. Since many different
types of exosomes exist in the whole blood, it is neces-
sary to isolate and detect disease-specific exosomes. For
this reason, the isolation and the detection of exosomes
is an important research issue and has been studied by
many
groups.
However,
limitations
such
as
low
throughput and low recovery still make it difficult to
use exosomes in diagnostics and therapeutics.
Methods: In this study, we developed an integrated
microfluidic
electrochemical
biosensor
to
extract
plasma from whole blood and subsequently detect can-
cer related exosomes in a continuous manner. This
consists of two parts. The first part is a channel for
extracting plasma containing exosomes from whole
blood, and the second part is a channel combined
with an electrochemical sensor for multiple detection
of
various
exosomes
in
the
extracted
plasma.
Previously,
a
Multi-Orifice
Flow
Fractionation
(MOFF) channel that consists of a series of expansion
and contraction structures has been developed in our
group. In this channel, the blood cells are moved to
sides of channels by hydrodynamic forces and then are
eliminated to outlets. At this time, the plasma is moved
to the electrochemical sensor part, the exosomes in the
plasma are captured to the electrodes immobilized with
the specific antibodies and are quantified the amount
of cancer-related exosomes.
Results: Using this chip, blood cells were eliminated
from the whole blood with over 90% of separation
efficiency at 225 µl/min flow rate and exosomes were
collected continuously with high recovery (~70%). In
order to quantify various types of exosomes, a label-
free electrochemical biosensor with Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used for the con-
tinuous detection of exosomes. The limit of detection
was 1x10^6 exosomes/ml.
Summary/Conclusion: The developed device is an
integrated device capable of separating exosomes
from whole blood with high purity and quantitating
exosomes through the electrochemical sensor in a con-
tinuous manner.

Introduction: Progress in the field of extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) is hampered by the challenge to produce large
amounts of EVs in a reproducible fashion (Paganini et
al, Biotech. J., 1800528, 2019). The development of high-
throughput techniques capable of simultaneously mon-
itoring physical and biochemical properties of EVs
would significantly simplify and accelerate the charac-
terization process. In this context, microfluidic technol-
ogy is emerging as an attractive platform. Here, we
present a microfluidic device based on the combination
of diffusion sizing and multi-wavelength fluorescence
detection to simultaneously provide information on EV
size, concentration and composition.

Methods: The diffusion of EVs in the microfluidic
channel provides information on their size distribution,
and four different staining protocols with high signal-
to-noise ratios track different EV native molecules. EVs
are separated from unbound fluorophores directly dur-
ing the microfluidic analysis, therefore avoiding the
need for sample pretreatments and allowing to operate
the device as a single-step immunoassay.
Results: The microfluidic device coupled with comple-
mentary staining techniques allows to individually
detect and size particle populations with different EV
components such as lipids, primary amines and the EV
marker CD63. We demonstrate that this approach can
probe the abundance of EV-specific markers and
impurities such as lipoproteins with high throughput
and low sample consumption.
Summary/Conclusion:
We
present
a
microfluidic
technique capable of characterizing and quantifying
EVs at low costs, in a time-scale of minutes and requir-
ing only up to 2 µL of non-pretreated sample. This
method is an important complementary tool to the
current array of biophysical methods for EV character-
ization, in particular for high-throughput screening
applications.

Introduction: Exosomes offer the potential to reveal
significant biological information in many areas of
clinical importance by virtue of their RNA contents
and protein surface markers. This abstract reports the
fabrication of a device for high throughput targeted
immunomagnetic capture of exosomes via the use of
highly-ordered nano-architected porous metal lattice
materials.
Methods: We have invented a fabrication technique to
precisely make millions of nanoscale exosome sorting
devices that can operate on unprocessed plasma. Each
nanoscale device can precisely sort targeted exosomes
from background vesicles but is too slow for practical
use individually. However, the operation of millions of
these devices in parallel preserves the precision of
nanoscale sorting while also enabling high throughput
and robust use on raw plasma samples. The metal
lattice within which these devices are contained is
assembled
via
metal
electroplating
onto
a
self-
assembled polystyrene bead lattice with face-centred
cubic (FCC) symmetry with 600 nanometre pores.
The devices feature a conformally-coated layer of
nickel-iron with gold passivation atop a base layer of
nickel, resulting in a lattice of millions of nanoscale
pores capable of magnetic sorting of exosomes tagged
via surface-marker-based immunomagnetic labelling
with magnetic nanoparticles.
Results: Compared to our previous work on immuno-
magnetic exosome capture via commercial track-etched
membranes (TEMPO), this device offers superior cap-
ture due to increased surface pore density (>25x) and
three-dimensional pore density (>1000x) alongside
lower required sample volume due to decreased non-
capturing volume in the device. Finite-element analysis
simulations show that strong magnetophoretic traps
emerge at the pore boundaries in this structure
between higher-permeability metals such as nickel-
iron permalloy and the lower-permeability sample
fluid in the device. Preliminary experimental data
shows that this device can isolate iron nanoparticles
in solution with >100x enrichment from input and 49x
capture efficacy versus TEMPO.
Summary/Conclusion: Current methods of exosome
isolation such as ultracentrifugation and column chro-
matography all suffer from low throughput and limited
yield. The application of inverse opal materials towards
exosome capture offers the potential for isolation of
specific exosome populations from very low clinical
sample volumes or sparse biological signals.

unknown how many independent culture conditions
like growth surface topography can alter the produc-
tion and content of EVs.
Methods: Standard 150 mm petri dishes were pat-
terned with 2 µm tall polystyrene microtracks spaced
by 5, 10 and 20 µm across a 100 mm area using
standard microfabrication techniques including photo-
lithography, soft lithography and microtransfer print-
ing. The micropatterns were characterized with SEM
and profilometry, then activated with oxygen plasma
and UV sterilized. MDAMB231 cells were seeded onto
patterned and smooth (control) dishes and grown in
serum-free media for the final 48 hours of culture. EVs
were isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation of
conditioned media and characterized using NTA,
TEM and western blot. Cell morphology was imaged
using immunocytochemistry and single cell migration
was characterized using time-lapse microscopy and
manual single cell tracking in FIJI.
Results: We demonstrate the simple and repeatable
fabrication of microtracks across a large surface area
in order to culture cells on topographically patterned
growth surfaces. Furthermore, we show that the 5 µm
spacing produced significantly more EVs than other
patterns as well as the highest cell aspect ratio and
average single cell migration speed (p < .05).
Summary/Conclusion: These findings have implica-
tions in both biomanufacturing of EVs and potentially
in enhancing the biomimicry of EVs produced in vitro.
However, further experimentation to assess the differ-
ences in cargo on patterned growth surface topographies
compared to conventional methods is still required.

Introduction: Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) is a
recently developed biophysical technology for the analy-
sis of molecular interactions. The motion of molecules
in temperature gradients allows the quantification of
biomolecule interactions by changes in conformation,
charge and size of a molecule induced by a binding
event. MST is a quick method, easy to handle, has a
low sample consumption, has no limitation on molecule
size, and enables measurements in solution, either in
various buffers or complex biological liquids. These
properties make MST an interesting tool for research
of extracellular vesicles (EVs); therefore, our aim is to
apply this method to EVs.
Methods: EVs were isolated from Jurkat cell line by differ-
ential centrifugation. Microscale Thermophoresis (MST)
and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) were used to ana-
lyse the interaction between antibody and EVs.
Results: We have demonstrated that interactions of
EVs with antibodies could be analysed by MST.
However, the tiny glass capillaries for sample mounting
represent a challenge due to adhesion of EVs to their
surface. We have tested commercial capillaries as well
as prepared capillaries in house coated by liposomes or
bovine serum albumin. The interactions between EVs
and antibodies were confirmed by Surface Plasmon
Resonance (SPR), which is an established method for
studying the interactions of EVs.
Summary/Conclusion:
Microscale
Thermophoresis
(MST) is a promising method for the analysis of EVs.

Introduction: The isolation of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) from cell culture supernatants and complex
body fluids, such as blood and urine, is of high impor-
tance for EV research as well as for future medical
applications in diagnostics and therapy. Nevertheless,
it is still challenging to reach the desired recovery,
purity and specificity due to many manual and time
intensive sample preparation steps. Conventional cen-
trifugation for EV isolation or sample preparation prior
to affinity-based separation methods can damage EVs
and cells, leading to misinterpretation of results or
inactive EVs. Alternative field flow fractionation meth-
ods employing acoustic fields are highly promising, but
so far limited to laboratory usage, based on a complex
(moulding) fabrication and/or hardly reproducible.
Here, we present an innovative surface acoustic wave

(SAW)-based acoustofluidic device for gentle sorting of
cells and particles.
Methods: Our device consists of interdigital transdu-
cers patterned on a piezoelectric substrate generating
SAW propagating on the substrate surface. Upon inter-
action of SAW with our on-chip structured, fluid-loa-
den microchannels, an acoustic pressure field is
developed across the fluid wherein particles are sus-
pended. This pressure field can be employed to simply
manipulate cells and particles based on their intrinsic
properties, such as size, density and compressibility in
continuous flow. The device is manufactured using
precise and low-cost microtechnological methods and
is suitable for reproducible mass fabrication.
Results: We demonstrated the separation of blood
components, i.e. the sorting of erythrocytes and throm-
bocytes. Furthermore, we could also show results on
thrombocyte activation indicating a gentle separation
without damaging these shear-sensitive cells, as well as
first results on plasma separation from whole blood
samples and nanoparticle sorting.
Summary/Conclusion: Our unique acoustofluidic sort-
ing technology for complex suspensions has the poten-
tial to overcome the need for time-effective, cheap and
gentle separation of EVs.

University, Coimbra, Portugal, Porto, Portugal
Introduction: Exosomes have an important role in
intercellular
communication
at
physiological
and
pathological
processes.
Their
cargo
includes
microRNAs
(miRs),
single-stranded
non-coding
RNAs, involved in alterations on recipient cells, such
as development of tumourous phenotype and metas-
tasis. More particularly, miR-21 excels due to its asso-
ciation with several cancers. Determining exosomal
miRs as cancer indicators demands selective and accu-
rate methods, which are not currently available or
entail high costs. Colorimetric photonic-based assays
are a promising label-free alternative, which dismisses
complex apparatus for signal reading since biorecog-
nition is detected by colour change. Moreover, the
clinical
and
economic
systems
have
also
been
demanding a decrease on the green footprint of bio-
sensors, requirement fulfilled with naturally derived
biomaterials.
Methods: Herein, the biosensor is constructed on a
biopolymer matrix to meet the requirements of an
eco-friendly disposable device, and it is based on a
photonic structure obtained by imprinting a nano-
pattern on the polymer surface. Then, the surface is
functionalized with the complementary oligonucleo-
tide sequence of miR-21 as sensing probe. A label-
free detection is thus envisioned and the sensor
performance is evaluated by changes in the optical
properties when the target is present.
Results: The combination of biological materials con-
ducted to a biosensor support with great flexibility and
low water permeability, allowing easy surface functio-
nalization. The self-reporting ability of the photonic-
based sensor enables high intensity colours detected by
naked eye.
Summary/Conclusion: The alliance with the high
selectivity of oligonucleotide hybridization is expected
to offer great exosomal miR-21 recognition ability and
an optimistic perspective for utilization in clinical
setups.

Introduction: Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are
important intercellular communicators. By systems
biology integration, uEVs prove to be relevant in geni-
tourinary disease detection. However, it has recently
been shown that labelled EVs administered to the cir-
culation can be detected in the urinary system, as well.
Thus, this pilot study aimed at phenotyping haemato-
poietic surface markers on uEVs to create enough
plausibility for future non-invasive biomarker studies
of circulation and immune disorders that may translate
into urine but are not yet timely recognized.
Methods: Urine was obtained from healthy men sign-
ing a written informed consent (n = 31). Sampling was
approved by the local ethics committee and in compli-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Cell-free urine
was obtained by serial centrifugation and 10 ml, each,
were utilized for the MACSPlex Exosome Kit, human
(Miltenyi Biotec). The manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions were followed to examine 37 distinct uEV surface
markers of CD9+/CD63+/CD81+ vesicles in a multi-
plexed bead-based manner including respective con-
trols. The Accuri C6 (BD) was utilized for data
acquisition.
For further MISEV2018-compliant characterization,
CD9+/CD63+/CD81+ uEVs were isolated by immu-
noaffinity and analysed by fluorescence nanoparticle
tracking (f-NTA), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and western blotting (WB).
Urinary creatinine (Ucrea) was determined to con-
trol for variances in urinary dilutions and used for data
normalization.
Results: Except CD209, all other 36 surface markers
could be identified. The most abundant markers were
CD9 and CD63, which were detected in 93% of sam-
ples, followed by CD133/1 (84%), CD326 (81%), CD81
and CD24 (77%, each). CD3 (42%), CD9, CD45 (39%),
CD49e (32%) and CD81 showed similar relative med-
ian fluorescent intensities (rMFI), while CD63 yielded
significantly higher (p = 0.009) and all other markers
significantly lower rMFI (p < 0.011).
TEM
and
f-NTA
revealed
cup-shaped
vesicles
(137 ± 22 nm) with 8.8 ± 7.0 E + 10 particles/g
Ucrea. WB indicated uEV isolates that were positive
for Alix, Syntenin, TSG101, CD9, CD63 and CD81
without any uromodulin or calnexin contamination.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results imply that consid-
erable quantities of circulatory EVs are, indeed, filtered
into urine and could serve as valuable non-invasive
biomarkers for systemic dysfunctions.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small
plasma membrane-derived vesicles released from var-
ious cells, which potentially affect many physiological
and pathophysiological processes, and are emerging as
a potential novel biomarker in cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs). However, there is little information about the
association of circulating EV levels with traditional
cardiovascular risk markers and CVD risk score.
Methods: • Subjects (n = 40) aged 40–70 yrs with
moderate risk of CVDs were recruited and assessed
for body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and
plasma lipid profile (triacylglycerol, total cholesterol
and high-density lipoprotein).

• EVs were isolated from platelet-free plasma by
size exclusion chromatography and analysed by both
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and flow
cytometry (FCM). NTA was used to measure the
concentration and size distribution of EVs popula-
tion, and EVs were phenotyped by FCM via a 3-
colour panel, which included Annexin V (for the
majority of circulating EVs), CD41 (for platelet-
derived
EVs)
and
CD105
(for
endothelial-
derived EVs).
• The association between risk markers and EV
numbers was examined by Pearson’s correlation
coefficient
and
stepwise
multivariate
regression
model. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was per-
formed after adjustment for various variables to
determine
the
correlation
between
the
quartile
range of EV numbers and 10-yr CVD risk detected
by QRISK2.
Results: EV numbers, as determined by NTA, were
strongly associated with BMI (r = 0.602, p < 0.001),
blood pressure (systolic BP: r = 0.359, p = 0.023; dia-
stolic BP: r = 0.550, p < 0.001) and plasma triacylgly-
cerol levels (r = 0.703, p < 0.001). Plasma total
cholesterol level was positively associated with plate-
let-derived EVs, determined by FCM (r = 0.330,
p = 0.038). A multivariate regression model demon-
strated that plasma triacylglycerol and diastolic BP
independently
predicted
total
EV
numbers,
with
plasma
triacylglycerol
concentrations
explaining
49.4% of the variance for total EV numbers. An addi-
tional 9.3% of the variance in total EV numbers was
predicted by diastolic BP. ANCOVA of the 10-yr CVD
risk score in the quartile range of total EV numbers
were positively and independently associated.
Summary/Conclusion: BMI, blood pressure, plasma
triacylglycerol and total cholesterol levels are strongly
associated with EV numbers. Plasma triacylglycerol
and diastolic BP independently predict circulating EV
numbers. Elevated numbers of EVs are independently
associated with 10-yr CVD risk.

tory T cells

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles from cardiosphere-
derived cells (CDC-EVs) are known to be anti-inflam-
matory in various disease models. To further dissect
the mechanism, we examined the effects of CDC-EVs
on T lymphocytes.
Methods: Naïve CD4 + T cells were isolated from
secondary lymphoid organs of Foxp3-RFP reporter
mice, using magnetic-activated and fluorescence-acti-
vated cell sorting. Cells were subsequently polarized
into effector subtypes (Th1, Th2, and Th17), as well
as regulatory T cells (Tregs), and the effects of exposure
to human-derived CDC-EVs on proliferation and cyto-
kine production were assessed. CDC-EVs were isolated
from serum-free, 15-day conditioned medium, using
ultrafiltration by centrifugation.
Results: After polarization and culture for 5 days,
CDC-EVs resulted in dose-dependent and cell-specific
proliferative responses. Effector T cells (Th1, Th2,
Th17) showed either no change in proliferation (Th1)
or decrease in proliferation (Th2, Th17), compared to
the vehicle control. In contrast, Tregs proliferated
much more than control (P < 0.0001). Next, we sought
to characterize the changes in cytokine production by
each effector T cell and Tregs. Compared to the vehicle
control, exposure of polarized effector T cells to CDC-
EVs had little effect on the expression of characteristic
cytokine genes, including Ifnγ and Tnfα (Th1), Il4 and
Il13 (Th2), or Il17a and Il17 f (Th17). In contrast,
exposure of Tregs to CDC-EVs resulted in ~1000-fold
increase in expression of Il10, a key paracrine agent
utilized by Tregs in suppression of inflammation. This
response was specific to CDC-EVs insofar as it was not
recapitulated
with
dermal
fibroblast
exosomes.
Concentrations of IL-10 in the culture media of
CDC-EV-conditioned Tregs mirrored the increases in
gene expression.
Summary/Conclusion: CDC-EVs potentiate Tregs by
increasing their proliferation and enhancing produc-
tion of IL-10. This offers an attractive therapeutic
approach to inflammatory diseases that relies on har-
nessing
an
endogenous
mechanism
of
immunosuppression.

Introduction: Prostanoids (epoprostenol, treprostinil
and iloprost) induce vasodilation in advanced pulmon-
ary arterial hypertension (PAH) but also inhibit platelet
activation, thereby increasing the risk of bleeding.
Therefore, the platelet function and extracellular vesicle
(EV) concentrations were measured in PAH patients
treated with prostanoids and compared to patients with
PAH not receiving prostanoids.
Methods: Venous blood was collected from 42 patients
treated
with
prostanoids
(study
group;
n
=
42,
50 ± 16 years, 70% female) and 38 patients not treated
with prostanoids (control group; n = 38, 55 ± 19 years,
65% female). Platelet reactivity was analysed in whole
blood by impedance aggregometry using arachidonic
acid (AA; 0.5 mM), adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 6.5
µM) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP;
32 µM) as agonists. In a subset of patients, concentra-
tions of EVs from platelets (CD61+ and CD62p+;
PEVs), leukocytes (CD45+, LEVs) and endothelial
cells (CD146+, EEVs) were measured in platelet-
depleted
plasma
by
flow
cytometry
(A60-Micro).
Platelet-rich thrombus formation was measured using
a whole blood perfusion system.
Results: Compared to the control group, patients trea-
ted with prostanoids had lower platelet reactivity in
response to AA and ADP (p = 0.01) and lower con-
centrations of PEVs and LEVs (p ≤0.05). Furthermore,
thrombus formation was delayed (p ≤0.003) and
thrombus size was decreased (p = 0.008) on prosta-
noids. Epoprostenol did not affect platelet reactivity in
vitro, but decreased the concentrations of CD61+ PEVs
(p = 0.04). In contrast, treprostinil and iloprost
decreased both platelet reactivity in response to AA
and ADP (p ≤0.05) and the concentrations of PEVs
(p ≤0.08). All prostanoids delayed thrombus formation
and decreased thrombus size (p ≤0.04).
Summary/Conclusion: Patients with PAH treated with
prostanoids have increased risk of bleeding both due to
impaired platelet aggregation, EV release and thrombus
formation, compared to patients not treated with pros-
tanoids.
Antiplatelet
effect
of
prostanoids
varies:
whereas epoprostenol decreases the release of PEVs,
treprostinil and iloprost impair platelet aggregation.

Nanoflow cytometry identifies an imbalance of epithelium- and neutro-
phil-derived extracellular vesicles in the airway environment of paediatric
cystic fibrosis patients

Guglani and Rabindra Tirouvanziam

Introduction: Progressive lung disease is the leading
cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic
condition characterized by recruitment of polymor-
phonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into the airways.
Newly arrived PMNs are exposed to extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) from the airway epithelium and PMNs
recruited before them. In controlled experiments,
these EVs were necessary and sufficient to induce
pathological changes including reduced bacterial killing
and immunosuppressive activities towards macro-
phages and T-cells. However, children with CF do not
always show a high PMN presence in their airways,
which suggests that the balance between PMN recruit-
ment and the activity of other cells is still in flux in
early stage disease.
Methods: We utilized spectral nanoflow cytometry to
profile the single EV content of the bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) from 17 CF children (<6 years of
age). For nanoflow cytometry, EVs were stained with
Di-8-ANEPPs, and with EpCAM, CD66b and CD115
(to ascertain epithelial, PMN, and macrophage ori-
gins, respectively). Violet side scatter and/or fluores-
cence

used
for
EV
detection.
Results: The ratio of neutrophil- to epithelial-derived
EVs in CF BALF correlated positively with the percen-
tage

PMNs
that
are
present
in
the

(p = 0.003, Spearman’s rho = 0.689). This ratio also

Summary/Conclusion: Using a method to quantify
EVs from specific cell types in vivo, we demonstrated
that the ratio of PMN- and epithelial cell-derived EVs
tracks with airway damage and neutrophil influx, sug-
gesting a critical interplay between these cells in early
CF disease. This EV-focused method can be applied to
other diseases in which sampling cells is difficult.
Future experiments will use CF BALF biobanks to
strengthen data presented here.

Introduction:
Circulating
cell-free
microRNAs
(miRNAs), often associated to extracellular vesicles
(EVs), are essential for cell-cell communication in the
pathogenesis of infectious pulmonary disorders. As
early pneumonia diagnosis is often clinically challen-
ging, advances in disease detection could improve out-
comes.
We
characterized
crude
EV
miRNAs
as
potential biomarkers for community-acquired pneu-
monia and sepsis as a severe secondary complication.
Methods: 142 individuals were enrolled into our study,
subdivided into a training (volunteer n = 27, pneumo-
nia n = 12, sepsis n = 28) and testing cohort (volunteer
n = 20, pneumonia n = 18, sepsis n = 37). After
precipitating
crude
EVs
from
sera
(miRCURY
Exosome Isolation Kit-Serum and Plasma) and extract-
ing total RNA, small RNA sequencing was performed.
miRNAs were selected as biomarker candidates by
differential gene expression analysis (DESeq2) and
sparse
partial-least-squares
discriminant
analysis
(mixOmics). Technical and biological validation was
performed by reverse transcription quantitative real-
time PCR. Group classification was predicted by par-
tial-least-squares discriminant analysis. Gene targets
and causal networks were identified by ingenuity path-
way analysis.
Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed
29 significantly regulated miRNAs in pneumonia com-
pared to volunteers, and 25 miRNAs in pneumonia
related to sepsis. Based on sparse-partial least discrimi-
nant analysis, group separation was achieved by 12
miRNAs as discriminators with high sensitivity and
specificity (area under the curve of the receiver oper-
ated curve: volunteer: 0.982, pneumonia: 0.965, sepsis:
0.992). miR-193a-5p (log2FC = 1.86, padj = 1.49E-6)
and miR-542-3p (log2FC = 1.67, padj = 3.29E-5) dif-
ferentiated between pneumonia and volunteers and
miR-1246 (log2FC = −2.41, padj = 1.78E-04) between
pneumonia and sepsis. Expression levels of miR-193a-
5p and miR-1246 were related to disease severity. miR-
542-3p was higher expressed in pneumonia compared
to volunteers and had equal expression in patient
groups. Prediction of group classification in the testing
cohort was 73.33%. Signalling networks were con-
structed for “cellular and humoral immune response”,
“antimicrobial response” and “pathogen influenced sig-
naling” involving the significantly regulated miRNAs.
Summary/Conclusion: Crude EV miRNAs are poten-
tially novel biomarkers for community-acquired pneu-
monia and may help to identify patients at risk for
progress to sepsis allowing early intervention and
treatment.

play an important role in the proinflammatory status
of the upper airway of asthma patients, especially in
those patients with severe asthma.
Methods:
In
a
pilot
study,3healthy
subjects
had
induced sputum using standard methods. After several
centrifugation steps, we were able to isolate exosomes
from sputum supernatant by both precipitation and
Size Exclusion Cromatography (SEC). Exosome size
was observed with Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) and the protein markers CD63 and CD81 were
analysed by Western Blot (WB). Then, total RNAs
were isolated from sputum exosomes and 9 miRNAs
(miR-103a-p, miR-191-5p, miR-320a, miR-200b-3p,
miR-185-5p,
miR-223-3p,
miR-21-5p,
miR-155-5p,
let-7 g-5p), were evaluated by RT-qPCR. After the
optimization of the methodology, 10 healthy adults
subjects and 10 patients with persistent moderate-
severe asthma, matched by age and sex were selected
and induced sputum was collected.
Results: Exosomes isolated with both methodologies
(precipitation and SEC) were observe under the TEM
with a correct range of size. Furthermore, WB assay
displayed a coherent protein profile for the exosome
markers CD63 and CD81. However, SEC displayed low
signal and the variability of between subjects was to
higher. Using the optimized method of precipitation,
we observed that after normalization, miRNA-320a
showed a significant increased (p = 0.02) in asthma
patients compared to control. This miRNA has been
linked with an active proinflammatory status.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results confirm the pre-
sence of exosomes in induced sputum with promising
applications in the field of asthma. The upregulation of
exosomal miR-320a, which is related with inflamma-
tion, suggest that exosomes could play a crucial role in
the chronic inflammation of airway described in
asthma patients.

Introduction: Multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) have
attracted much attention for their capacity to accelerate
wound healing. Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesi-
cles, may be key to translating MSC therapy. We pre-
viously found that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates MSC promotion of diabetic
tissue repair. Here, we explore a novel role of Nrf2 in
exosome biogenesis and investigate whether exosome
treatment recapitulates the effects MSCs have on healing.
Methods: Exosomes were harvested by differential
ultracentrifugation
of
conditioned
bone
marrow
derived MSC media. For Nrf2-active exosomes, MSCs
were incubated with potent Nrf2 activator, CDDO-Im.
Exosomes and MSCs were vigorously characterized.
Full-thickness humanized-stented wounds were created
on adult Leprdb/db diabetic mice (db/db). Exosomes
were injected intradermally and circumferentially to
the wound margin.
Results: MSCs adopt an adherent fibroblast morphol-
ogy, demonstrate robust osteogenic, chondrogenic,
and adipogenic differentiation, express >95% positive
MSC markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105) and
<5% express negative markers (CD45, CD31, CD14,
CD19, or HLA-DR). Immunoblotting of MSC exo-
somes shows enrichment for positive exosomal mar-
kers CD81, CD9 and TSG101. Nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA) shows a nanoparticle population with
mean diameter of 168.0 ± 6.5 nm. Transmission elec-
tron microscopy of exosomes reveals flattened cup-like
spheres. NTA demonstrates that Nrf2-active human
MSCs increase exosome secretion by 54%, compared
to Nrf2-baseline MSCs (p < 0.05). Both Nrf2-baseline
and
Nrf2-active
exosome
treatment
significantly
reduced closure time to 15.5 and 14 days respectively,
compared to 29.8 days for vehicle-treated wounds
(p < 0.05). This reduction eliminated the delay in
closure time compared to wounds of C57/B6 mice.
Nrf2-active exosome treatment of db/db wounds
reduced closure time by a further 2.6 days compared
to untreated C57/B6 wounds. At day 10, exosome-
treated db/db wounds have significant decreases in
epithelial gap, expanded granulation tissue, and greater
density of CD31+ vessels compared to vehicle-treated
wounds.
Summary/Conclusion: Enhancing Nrf2 function in
MSCs multiplies exosome yield. Our results demon-
strate exosome-based therapies hold tremendous pro-
mise and warrant further investigation for rapid
translation.

Introduction: Obesity increases prostate cancer aggres-
siveness and adipose tissue (AT) is a rich source of
extracellular vesicles (EV) that have been shown to
contribute to pro-oncogenic effects in various malig-
nancies. Twist1 is a key mediator of tumour cell metas-
tasis. The goal of this study was to determine molecular
and phenotypic changes of prostate cancer cells in
response to EVs from obese human AT and the role
of different levels of endogenous Twist1.
Methods: EV were harvested from human AT (ATEV)
obtained from bariatric subjects or from AT endothe-
lial cells treated with proinflammatory cytokines (PIC-
EV) to mimic the obese AT environment. EVs were
isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized by
electron microscopy, NTA and protein markers. We
determined the effect of ATEV and PIC-EV on PC3-
ML prostate cancer cells proliferation and invasion. EV
miRNA cargo and transcriptome of PC3-ML cells trea-
ted with ATEV or PIC-EV were assessed using
NanoString. To establish the contribution of Twist to
the EV-related phenotypic and molecular changes in
recipient cells, we used PC3-ML lines stably overex-
pressing or deficient in Twist1.
Results: ATEV from obese subjects and EV-PIC
from AT endothelial cells both reduced invasion
and increased proliferation in wild-type PC3-ML
cells.
A
molecular
signature
showing
decreased
expression of genes mediating invasion, adhesion
and metabolism supported these functional effects.
Also ATEV and EV-PIC shared a subset of miRNA
that target multiple MMPs, inhibit glycolytic genes
and target cell cycle inhibitory genes. PC3-ML over-
expressing Twist1 showed an increase in both pro-
liferation and invasiveness and this phenotype was
supported by the transcriptomic analysis following
EV treatment.
Summary/Conclusion: EV produced by obese AT or
by AT endothelial cells share a subset of miRNA that in
conjunction with increased Twist1 expression contri-
bute to tumorigenesis and metastasis of prostate cancer
cells in vitro.

Introduction: Exercise is associated with various health
benefits, including the prevention and management of
obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors. However, a
strong heterogeneity in the adaptive response to exer-
cise training exists. Differential response to exercise
training might be mediated by myokines (proteins,
nucleic acids, metabolites) that can be released directly
into the systemic circulation, or packaged within extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs). The objective of this study was
to evaluate if changes in EVs after acute aerobic exer-
cise (AE) were associated with the responders pheno-
type following 6-week resistance exercise (RE) training.
Methods: This is a secondary analysis of plasma sam-
ples from the EXIT trial (clinical trial #02204670).
Eleven sedentary obese youth (15.7 ± 0.5 years, BMI
≥95th percentile underwent an acute bout of AE (60%
heart rate reserve, 45 min). Blood was collected before
[time (AT) −15, 0 min], during [AT15, 30, 45 min],
and after [15 min (AT60), 75 min (AT120)] exercise.
Afterwards, youth participated in 6-week RE pro-
gramme, and were categorized into responders or
non-responders (NR) based on changes in insulin sen-
sitivity (above or below 50 percentile). Primary out-
come:
EVs
were
isolated
using
size
exclusion
chromatography (Izon®) at baseline (AT0), immedi-
ately after AE (AT45) and after recovery (AT120). EV
protein concentration, size, and zeta potential were
analysed in a single-blind fashion.
Results: Responders had larger EVs (~141.1 nm) as
opposed to NRs (~97.3 nm) at AT0 (p < 0.05) and
this pattern was maintained at AT45 and AT120,
though not significant (p = 0.1). NRs displayed
differential EV size distribution (peaks at 100 nm
or 300 nm), while EV distribution was highest at
250 nm in responders. No difference in average
zeta potential or total EV protein yield was observed
between groups. An increase in EV yield with exer-
cise time and recovery was observed in both groups.
Summary/Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest
that EV size is significantly increased after an acute
bout of AE in obese youth responders. Further research
to delineate the role of EVs as predictors of exercise
adaptation is warranted.

vesicles

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from tissues
like skeletal muscle (SkM) and adipose tissue (AT)
have been implicated in human disease but are under-
studied. SkM is likely a major player in EV biology as it
accounts for ~35% of total body mass. Tools to define
cellular EV origin are needed because tissues like SkM
are comprised of a variety of cell types. Here, we
describe our ongoing efforts using the dual fluorescent
mG/mT mouse as a tool to analyse SkM-myocyte
derived EVs.
Methods: Wild-type (WT) and mG/mT mice were
used for these studies. mG/mT mouse cells express
membrane-tagged red (mT) or green (mG) fluorescent
protein in the absence or presence of Cre, respectively.
We made SkM myocyte mG expressing mice using a
mouse expressing Cre on the human skeletal actin
promoter. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture
and platelet-free plasma was obtained via centrifuga-
tion.
Plasma
EVs
were
isolated
using
Exoquick,
Exoquick-TC or size exclusion chromatography. SkM
and AT were dissected into ~5mm chunks, placed in
serum-free DMEM and incubated for 24 hours. Tissue-
derived EVs were isolated using Exoquick-TC. EV
abundance was determined with a Horiba ViewSizer.

Individual EVs were analysed with a Cytek Aurora
spectral flow cytometer. Settings were optimized using
polystyrene beads and spectral unmixing was per-
formed to allow detection of mG and mT.
Results: In WT mice, SkM releases >100 times more
EVs than adipose tissue per unit of mass (p < 0.01
using paired Student’s t-test). Since SkM is also a
major component of total body mass, these data further
emphasize the importance of SkM-derived EVs. SkM-
derived EVs from WT mice were not fluorescent
(<0.1% of events). EVs from mG/mT mouse SkM over-
whelmingly expressed mG (>95% of events) with neg-
ligible (< 1%) expression of mT. AT-derived EVs
robustly expressed mT but lacked mG.
Summary/Conclusion: These data provide “proof-of-
principle” that mG and mT are readily incorporated
into EVs secreted ex vivo. Surprisingly however,
plasma EVs from mG/mT mice expressed very little
mG (~3%) or mT (~ 4%). This observation was con-
firmed with three separate isolation techniques. We are
currently exploring possibilities to explain this finding,
including: 1) modification of EVs post-secretion, 2)
clearance of fluorescent EVs by the liver or 3) that
EVs secreted from tissues remain predominantly in
the interstitial space.

Endothelial CD36 delivery of FA loaded extracellular vesicles is critical for
thermogenesis.

Introduction: Membrane CD36 facilitates tissue fatty
acid (FA) uptake. We recently found that endothelial
cell (EC) CD36 controls muscle and adipose tissue
FA uptake, and influences the tissue’s metabolic phe-
notype. The mechanism for CD36-facilitated FA
uptake is unknown. Here we examined the role of
EC CD36 in thermogenesis and in FA delivery to
brown fat tissue.
Methods: Adult male mice were housed individually,
restricted
from
food
during
acute
(4
hr)
cold
exposure (4°C) with core temperature monitored
every 30 minutes. After 4 hours, animals were sacri-
ficed and samples collected for analysis. For cellular
studies, human microvascular (Lonza) or primary
murine microvascular EC were used. For primary
cells, crude cell pellets from lung homogenates were
purified
using
mouse-CD31
magnetic
beads
(Miltenyi).
For
microscopy
studies,
alkyne
FA
(Cayman) was added to cells and to enable visualiza-
tion of internalized FAs, click chemistry (Invitrogen)
used to label alkyne-FA with Alexa 568. For radio-
active studies, primary lung EC were serum starved
for 5 hrs and incubated overnight with 3H-oleic acid
bound to FA-free BSA (2:1 ratio). Media was col-
lected, clarified by centrifugation to remove micro-
vesicles and debris. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
were
isolated
from
clarified
media
using
Total
Exosome Isolation reagent (Invitrogen) and counted
for radioactivity.
Results: Basal core body temperatures are similar in
mice lacking EC CD36 (ecCD36-/-) compared to con-
trols (CD36fl/fl). However, during cold exposure at 4°
C, ecCD36-/- are unable to maintain body temperature
(p < 0.001). Plasma free FA are higher in cold exposed
ecCD36-/- indicating FA clearance by brown fat is
impaired. Mitochondrial function and expression of
thermogenic and mitochondrial genes in brown fat
from ecCD36-/- and CD36fl/fl mice were similar.
These data suggested that endothelial delivery of FAs
is necessary for thermogenic maintenance of body
temperature.
To examine FA handling by ECs we used alkyne FAs
to visualize the process. We found that FAs are trans-
ferred by microvascular EC through caveolae-mediated
transcytosis involving Src signalling and Cav-1 phos-
phorylation. The internalized Cav-1 and CD36 positive
vesicles containing FAs are released as sEVs. To deter-
mine the dependence of CD36 on this process, we
treated primary microvascular EC with radiolabeled
FA and found that sEVs secreted by CD36-/- cells
contain less labelled-FA (p = 0.05).
Summary/Conclusion: Endothelial delivery of FA is
critical for thermogenesis. Our working model for the
mechanism of FA uptake by brown adipose tissue is the
following: Endothelial cells transfer the FA through
caveolae-mediated transcytosis and secrete small extra-
cellular vesicles (sEVs) that help deliver FAs to brown
adipocytes.

Introduction: Diet-induced obesity modifies intestinal
permeability leading to bacteria infiltration and to a
decrease in the number of immune cells protecting
mucosa. As orange consumption is beneficial for
human health and used in preventive medicine, we
determined whether orange juice-derived nanovesicles
(ONV) might be recommended as nutritional strategies
for the treatment of intestinal complications associated
with obesity.
Methods: ONV isolated from fresh orange juices were
characterized by lipidomic, metabolomic, microscopy,
NTA and for their stability during digestion. Intestinal
barrier (IB = Caco-2 cells+HT-29 cells differentiated
with oleic acid) were treated with ONV and co-cul-
tured with adipocytes to monitor IB fat absorption and
release. Obesity was induced in mice fed for 12 weeks
with a high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHS mice vs stan-
dart chow diet mice). Then half of the HFHS mice were
gavaged with 150 micrograms/day for 4 weeks.
Results: ONV did not modify high-fat high-sucrose
diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance but reversed
diet-induced gut modifications. Six hours post-gavage,
ONV accumulated preferentially in jejunum involved
in lipid absorption. In jejunum, and no other intestinal
region, ONV increased villi size, restored immune
response
and
decreased
barrier
permeability
in
HFHSD mice. In addition, ONV-treated mice had
increased expressions of ACAT2, ANGPTL4 and
DGAT1,
but
a
decreased
expression
of
FABP2,
FATP4, MTP vs HFHSD animals, which indicated
that fat absorption, TG synthesis and chylomicron
release were strongly reduced. Similarly to other
plant-derived nanovesicles, these results were likely
associated with ONV lipid and metabolite composi-
tions (strong enrichment in bioactive phospholipids:
PE, PA, PC, PI and leucine) as ONV did not resist to
harsh digestive conditions in vitro and were poorly
incorporated in enterocytes. As the effects of ONV on
the decrease in TG content and epithelial cell growth
were also observed in vitro, gut microbiota unlikely
participate to these effects.
Summary/Conclusion: ONV are important bioactive
compounds of orange juice and for the first time we
demonstrated that they can modulate lipid metabolism
in the intestinal barrier associated with morphological
changes. Interestingly ONV treatment targets MTP and
ANGPTL4 mRNAs, 2 therapeutic intestinal targets to
reduce plasma lipids and for attenuating inflammation
in gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, ONV might be
used to reduce the development of dyslipidemia-asso-
ciated diseases and to restore intestinal functions in
obese patients.

Association, structure, and function of fibronectin in extracellular vesicles
from hepatocytes
Xinlei Li, Ruju Chen, Sherri Kemper and David Brigstock
Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, USA
Introduction: We have shown that extracellular vesi-
cles from normal hepatocytes have anti-fibrogenic
activity and that they preferentially bind to hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs, the principal fibrosis-causing cell
in the liver) and hepatocytes. In this study, our goal
was to determine the molecular nature of the EV com-
ponents involved in cell binding. Fibronectin (FN1) is a
key component of extracellular matrix, functioning in
processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, and
wound healing. Two types of FN1 are present in verte-
brates, of which the soluble plasma FN1 is derived
principally
from
hepatocytes,
while
cell-associated
FN1 is produced by numerous cell types. Here we
describe a novel function of plasma FN1 in facilitating
binding of hepatocyte EVs to target cells.
Methods: Differential ultracentrifugation was used to
collect EVs released by parental mouse AML12 hepa-
tocytes, FN1 KO AML12 cells in which FN1 was
ablated using CRISPR-cas9, primary human or mouse
hepatocytes, or human HepG2 cells, or from human or
mouse serum. EVs were characterized by nanosight
tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot, iodixanol gra-
dient ultracentrifugation, and mass spectrometry. The
binding efficiency of PKH26-labelled EVs from paren-
tal (EV-Hep) or FN1 KO (EV-HepFN1 KO) AML12
cells was analysed in hepatocytes or HSCs. Swiss
Webster mice were injected with CCl4 for five weeks
to induce liver fibrosis, with some mice also receiving i.

p. administration of EV-Hep or EV-HepFN1 KO over
the last two weeks, followed by determination of hepa-
tic fibrogenic genes by qRT-PCR.
Results: EV-Hep or EV-HepFN1 KO were 50–200 nm
in diameter and positive for common EV markers
(CD63, CD9, flotillin-1). Mass spectrometry showed
that FN1 was the most abundant protein in EV-Hep
and comprised principally the plasma form. The abun-
dant presence of EV FN1 was verified by Western blot
and co-immunoprecipitation with anti-CD9 or anti-
flotillin-1. Western blot showed that FN1 was also
abundant in EVs from primary human or mouse hepa-
tocytes, HepG2 cells, and human or mouse serum. FN1
and EV-Hep co-sedimented at a density of ~1.15 g/ml.
EV-HepFN1 KO yield and size-range were similar to
those of EV-Hep, suggesting that EV biogenesis is
FN1-independent. As compared to EV-Hep, the bind-
ing of EV-HepFN1 KO to target cells was highly
reduced whereas EV binding was independent of FN1
expression by the target cells themselves. Both EV-
HepFN1 KO and EV-Hep were anti-fibrogenic in
vivo but only EV-Hep attenuated collagen 1⍺1 expres-
sion in mouse HSCs in vitro.
Summary/Conclusion: FN1 is abundantly associated
with hepatocyte EVs and facilitates EV binding to
target hepatocytes or HSCs. Additional studies are
needed to clarify the functional role of FN1 in mediat-
ing EV-Hep anti-fibrogenic actions in vitro or in vivo.

Introduction: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized
by reduced beta cell mass and function. Islet amyloid,
formed by aggregation of human islet amyloid poly-
peptide (hIAPP), contributes to progressive beta cell
loss in T2D. Amyloid also forms in human islets dur-
ing pre-transplant culture and following transplanta-
tion in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) which is
associated with graft failure. The cellular mechanisms
underlying islet amyloid formation are still unclear. In
this study, we examined the potential role of islet-
derived extracellular vesicles (EV) in the clearance of
soluble and aggregated (pro)IAPP species from beta
cells and amyloid formation.
Methods: Human islets isolated from cadaveric pan-
creatic donors (n = 4 donors) and wild-type or hIAPP-
expressing (hIAPP+) transgenic mouse islets (n = 4/
group) were cultured in normal (5.5 mM) or elevated
(11.1 mM) glucose to form amyloid. EV (exosomes)
were isolated from culture medium using classical cen-
trifugation and ultracentrifugation. Purified EV were
analysed by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Western
blot analysis and double immunogold transmission
electron microscopy were performed to verify the pre-
sence of EV markers as well as (pro)hIAPP species and
oligomers (aggregates).
Results: Human islets formed amyloid during culture
with elevated glucose which was associated with pro-
gressive beta cell apoptosis. (Pro)IAPP species were
detectable in EV released from human islets cultured
in normal and elevated glucose. The latter markedly
increased
(pro)IAPP
content
in
islet-derived
EV.
Interestingly, hIAPP aggregates (oligomers) were pre-
sent in the majority of EV released from human islets
cultured in elevated glucose but were not detectable in
islets cultured with normal glucose. Similarly, EV
released from hIAPP+ mouse islets which formed amy-
loid during culture had higher (pro)IAPP content com-
pared to wild-type islet-derived EV. Moreover, hIAPP
oligomers were present in EV derived from hIAPP+
islets but not WT islets.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, our data show
that (pro)IAPP species are present in islet-derived EV
and that elevated glucose increases (pro)hIAPP and its
aggregates in EV released from islets. Islet-derived EV
may play a key role in the process of amyloid forma-
tion in T2D and human islet grafts.

Contraction, but not glycolysis, regulates the size of skeletal muscle EVs
secreted ex vivo.

Introduction: Skeletal muscle (SkM) is a metabolically
active tissue and accounts for ~35% of total human

Muscle

increases
the
demand for ATP which requires intercellular commu-
nication in order to adapt. We hypothesized that this
“metabolic stress” during contraction increases SkM
EV secretion.
Methods: We tested our hypothesis using an ex
vivo EV secretion assay. All studies were approved
by
the
Colorado
State
University
Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Vastus medialis
muscle (SkM) from male C57Bl/6 J mice (n = 6) or
female mT/mG mice (n = 6) was cut into ~5 mg
pieces and added to 12 well plates (~50 mg/well)
filled with 1 ml of serum-free DMEM and placed in
a cell culture incubator at 37 C for 24 hours. SkM
from male mice was treated with 2-deoxyglucose
(2-DG) (0.1 nM – 100 mM) to induce metabolic
stress via inhibition of glycolysis. SkM from female
mice was treated with 10uM of blebbistatin (BLEB),
a contraction inhibitor. After incubation, SkM mass
was measured and conditioned media was centri-
fuged (3,000 x g for 15 min) to remove cell debris.
EVs were isolated using ExoQuick-TC. NTA was
performed
on
isolated
EVs

then
reported

Statistical
comparisons
for

were
made
using a repeated measures 1-way ANOVA. BLEB
experiments
were
analysed
using
a
paired
Student’s t-test.
Results: There was a trend towards greater EV abun-
dance (p = 0.07) as a function of 2-DG treatment,
but no effect on EV diameter (p = 0.37). BLEB
treatment did not alter EV abundance (p = 0.69),
but
significantly
reduced
EV
mean
diameter
(p = 0.007; 11% decrease; DMSO: 114.9 ± 5.1 vs.
BLEB: 103.9 ± 4.2).
Summary/Conclusion: Contrary to our hypothesis,
inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG did not stimulate
SkM EV secretion. However, BLEB did appear to pro-
mote the release of small EVs and/or inhibit secretion
of larger EVs. Ongoing efforts are focused on testing
other metabolic stressors and defining how blebbistatin
promotes small EV secretion.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs, exosomes)
are nanovesicles (30–200 nm) secreted from various
types of cells. Because of vesicular encapsulation of
miRNAs and enzymes, the EVs play crucial roles in
cell-to-cell communication by delivering these func-
tional molecules to other cells [1]. On the other hand,
the EVs are highly expected as next generation thera-
peutic tools due to pharmaceutical advantages such as
controlled immunogenicity, effective usage of cell-to-
cell communication routes, artificial modification and
encapsulation of functional molecules. However, cellu-
lar targeting and uptake efficacy of the EVs are insuffi-
cient to be utilized as therapeutic tools [2, 3]. In this
study, we newly developed EVs decorated with cell-
penetrating sC18 or (sC18)2 peptides, which are
derived from the C-terminal domain of the cationic
antimicrobial protein, CAP18, because the peptides
can be efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells.
[4, 5].
Methods: All peptides were prepared by Fmoc-solid
phase synthesis. Secreted EVs from CD63-GFP stably
expressing HeLa cells were isolated by ultracentrifuga-
tion. Cellular uptake of EVs was analysed using a flow
cytometer
and
a
confocal
laser
microscope.
Encapsulation of saponin in the EV was conducted by
electroporation.
Results: sC18 peptide is known as one of cell-penetrat-
ing peptides, and branched structure of sC18 peptides,
(sC18)2, further enhances the cellular uptake [5]. In
this research, we examined the effects of the peptide
modification on cellular EV uptake, and modification
of the sC18 or (sC18)2 peptides on EV membranes was
conducted via stearyl moiety. As our results, increased
macropinocytotic cellular uptake by modification of
the peptides was successfully attained. Especially, the
modification of (sC18)2 peptides showed higher cellu-
lar uptake and macropinocytosis induction efficacy
than that of sC18 peptides. In addition, anticancer
protein,
saporin
toxin-encapsulated
EVs
modified
with the (sC18)2 peptides significantly enhanced their
biological activity with dependency of glycosaminogly-
can expression on targeted cells.
Summary/Conclusion: The cell-penetrating (sC18)2
peptide-modified EVs shows high abilities to be effec-
tively internalized by cells and are applicable for intra-
cellular delivery of therapeutic molecules. This study is
expected to contribute to development of intracellular
delivery techniques based on EVs.

Introduction: RNA therapeutics possess high potential
which is yet to be realised, largely due to difficulties
involved in delivery to the cytoplasm of target cells.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) possess numerous features
that may help overcome this hurdle and have emerged
as a promising RNA delivery vehicle candidate. Despite
extensive research into the engineering of EVs for RNA
delivery, little is known about how their intrinsic RNA
delivery efficiency compares to current synthetic RNA
delivery systems. Using a novel CRISPR/Cas9 based

we here compared the delivery efficiency of EVs to
state-of-the-art DLin-MC3-DMA lipid nanoparticles
(LNPs).
Methods: EVs were isolated from MDA-MB-231
cells expressing either a targeting or non-targeting
control sgRNA and applied to HEK293 T stoplight+
reporter cells. LNPs containing targeting sgRNA
were titrated onto HEK293 T stoplight+ reporter
cells to determine the minimum effective dose. LNP
and EV particles were characterized using nanopar-
ticle tracking analysis, dynamic light scattering and
zeta potential analysis. sgRNA copy number was
determined using RT-qPCR.
Results: EVs were 140 ± 7 nm in diameter as mea-
sured by DLS and possessed a negative surface
charge of −25.3 ± 3.3 mV. RT-qPCR and NTA ana-
lysis indicated that sgRNA EV loading was low, with
only 1 in 3.8e05 ± 3.5e05 EVs containing a single
sgRNA copy. Nevertheless, EVs containing targeting
sgRNA induced significant reporter activation while
EVs containing non-targeting sgRNA did not. LNPs
were 51 ± 0.6 nm in diameter and possessed a
neutral charge. These particles also induced signifi-
cant reporter activation when loaded with targeting
sgRNA. When delivered via EVs, only between 4 to
54 sgRNA copies per cell were required to induce
statistically significant reporter activation. In con-
trast, the minimal effective sgRNA dose when deliv-
ered
by
LNPs
was
considerably
higher
at
approximately 9e03 copies per cell.
Summary/Conclusion: MDA-MB-231 EVs deliver
RNA in a highly efficient manner and are functional
at sgRNA concentrations several orders of magnitude
lower than those required for LNP mediated delivery.
This underlines the potential of EVs as RNA delivery
vehicles
and

Introduction: Chagas Disease is a neglected tropical
disease (NTD) caused by the flagellated protozoan
Trypanosoma cruzi. It is a major public health problem
in Latin America, and it is now expanding over the globe
through immigration of infected individuals. Eukaryotic
cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that circulate in
body fluids and have an important roles in intercellular
communication, both in physiological and pathological
conditions. Objectives. Our study proposes to character-
ize and to compare the circulating EVs isolated from
plasma of the Chronic Chagas Disease (CCD) patients
with healthy individuals (controls).
Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from patients
and controls in the presence of EDTA and EVs enriched
from plasma by differential ultracentrifugation. The
obtained EVs were characterized and quantified by
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and added to
human THP-1 cells. After 48 h, the cell supernatants
were analysed by ELISA for the presence of cytokines.
Results: Lower amounts of EVs were obtained from
CCD patients in comparison with control individuals.
However, the same amount of EVs of CCD were more
capable of inducing cytokines such as IFN-gamma and
IL-17 in relation to controls.
Summary/Conclusion: Although less EVs are present in
the blood of CCD, these EVs induce high inflammatory
reactions on macrophages suggesting a possible role of
these EVs in the establishment of chronic disease.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may prove to
be one of the optimal payload carriers for therapeutic
agents. While they travel through the extracellular space,
the EV’s lipid membrane layer shields their luminal
cargo from deleterious external factors. When autolo-
gous EVs are used to protect this therapeutic cargo, little
immunogenic effects are expected compared to viral

vectors and artificial structures, such as liposomes. Their
usage is potentially manifold, and they are ubiquitously
present in all body tissues and fluids. The key is to
develop a manageable EV loading agent for adoptive
transfer therapies.
Methods: To exploit the unique properties of EVs, highly
positively charged proteins were used to load them with
multiple biomolecules, such as a Cas9 protein or Dicer
substrate dsRNA as a functional payload and to improve
their apparently inadequate natural ability to deposit
cargo into the cytoplasm of recipient cells.
Results: Highly positively charged proteins can associate
with and/or diffuse through a phospholipid bilayer
(Thompson et al. 2012). When these kinds of charged
proteins are mixed with isolated EVs in vitro, they are
loaded into the EVs. The positive charge of the protein
has the advantage that it can associate with negatively
charged agents, such as RNA species, and aids the asso-
ciated molecule to also incorporate into the EV.
Moreover, the positive charge of the protein helps with
cargo delivery, and thus overcoming the bottleneck of
the EV’s cargo to escape the endosome post-uptake in a
recipient cell. Self-quenching fluorescent lipid dyes
demonstrated that discharge of the highly positive EV
cargo into the cytoplasm is concomitant with lipid mix-
ing between the membrane of EVs and the membrane of
the recipient cell. When eGFP-expressing microglia were
exposed to EVs loaded with a Dicer substrate dsRNA
able to silence eGFP via the positively charged protein,
the uptake of Dicer substrate dsRNA was concomitant
with a decrease in eGFP expression in the microglia. A
similar result was achieved when EVs were loaded with
Cas9 protein conjugated to the highly positively charged
protein. Post-uptake of these Cas9-loaded EVs, microglia
expressing anti-eGFP sgRNA (single guide RNA) lead to
decreased eGFP expression.
Summary/Conclusion: Our EV delivery technology
has the capability of delivering multiple biomolecules,
such as protein and RNA cargo and demonstrates post-
uptake of the EV functionality of the EV delivered
cargo in the recipient cell.

Introduction:
Traditional
drug
delivery
systems
(DDS) are usually based on liposomes, micelles or
dendrimers. Unfortunately, many DDS cause side
effects including organ toxicity and/or unexpected
immune response. In living organisms, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) are responsible for delivering biolo-
gically active molecules to distant cells. In vitro
loading of therapeutic compounds into EVs is still
not effective and needs developing new strategies.
For these reasons we aimed to design hybrid extra-
cellular vesicles (hEVs) with high loading capacity
for DDS.
Methods:
For
hEV
synthesis,
we
used
human
endothelial
derived
EVs.
Using
freeze/thawing
method we fused them with liposomes composed of
cholesterol and one of the three lipids: DOPC, sphin-
gomyelin or phosphatidylserine. To confirm mem-
brane fusion, we applied a spectroscopy ruler –
FRET
(Förster
Resonance
Energy
Transfer)
and
CryoTEM
imaging
technique.
We
characterized
hEVs using NTA (for size distribution evaluation),
DLS (zeta potential) and Western blot (for detection
of EVs markers). We evaluated loading efficiency
using calcein as a model drug. Additionally, we per-
formed cytotoxicity tests.
Results: In the CryoTEM imaging, pure and homo-
genous
hEV
population
with
a
diameter
of
65 ± 15 nm was detected. Additionally, we observed
changes in zeta potential and in size distribution after
fusion. FRET measurements showed increased fusion
efficiency with the increasing number of freeze/thaw-
ing cycles and dependence on a lipid-to-protein ratio
in EVs. Additionally, hEV had higher loading effi-
ciency than liposomes and sole EVs and that their
internalization by endothelial cells did not cause a
cytotoxic effect.
Summary/Conclusion: Based on cryo-TEM and FRET,
we confirmed that our fusion method of hybrid EVs is
effective and can be applied as a delivery platform for
DDS to endothelial cells.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been
demonstrated to be important mediators of intercellu-
lar communication in various contexts, including in
response to a range of stressors. The functional activity
of these EVs in recipient cells may, in part, be driven
by changes to their biological cargoes. However, the
molecular details of the underlying EV biogenesis and
loading processes, and how this may vary in different
conditions, is poorly understood.
Methods: We first studied the effect of oxidative stress
on the functional activity of EVs in recipient cells using
cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential
assays in Drosophila S2R+ cells. We then carried out
total RNA sequencing of EV and cellular RNA under
three stress conditions and compared results to existing
data in mouse cells. Further to this we have used a
bioinformatic pipeline to identify sequence motifs
enriched in EVs under stress.
Results: Functional assays indicated changes to cell
viability and mitochondrial membrane potential in
recipient cells, which were donor cell-stress dependent.
Subsequent characterisation of RNA showed an enrich-
ment of ribosomal RNA in EVs relative to cells, but no
significant changes to other biotypes. Comparative
analysis has also uncovered a set of genes enriched in
EVs under oxidative stress, and a further subset whose
enrichment may be evolutionarily conserved in mouse.
We also identified potential EV-loading motifs which
may assist in RNA loading specifically under stress.
Summary/Conclusion: We have shown that EVs
derived from oxidatively stressed cells show dose-
dependent differences in RNA cargo and identified
potential sequence motifs that may have a role in its
loading. We are now validating the biological signifi-
cance of these findings by combining different in vivo
approaches in Drosophila. This will enable us to gain
insights into the basic mechanisms which govern EV
loading in different contexts, and ultimately the mole-
cular mechanisms underlying EV-mediated intercellu-
lar communication.

Introduction: Mutations in TP53 are considered one
of the most frequent genetic alterations in human
cancer. Besides the abrogation of the wild-type (WT)
p53-mediated tumour suppression, a distinct set of
missense mutations was reported to endow mutant
p53 proteins with novel activities termed gain-of-func-
tion (GOF). Even though mutations in TP53 are typi-
cally thought to arise in the tumour cells rather than in
the stroma, the non-cell-autonomous effects of these
mutants over the tumour microenvironment are poorly
understood.
In the presented studies, focusing on colon cancer as
well as on lung cancer microbiome, we investigated
intercellular interactions mediated by exosomes and

outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in the context of
cancers harbouring mutant p53.
Methods: p
Results: In the colon, tumour cells harbouring mutp53
were found to exert a non-cell-autonomous effect over
macrophages. When exposed to tumour cells harbour-
ing mutp53, monocytes became polarized towards a
distinguished subset of macrophages characterized by
TAMs-related markers. The mutant p53 affected TAM
were characterized as TNF-αlow/IL-10 high, over
expressing CD-206 and CD163, with decreased phago-
cytic ability and increased invasion and matrix degra-
dation potency. Investigating the exosomal transfer
from mutp53 tumour cells to macrophages, revealed a
mutp53-specific miRs signature led by miR-1246 pro-
moting the TAM phenotype and creating an invasive
front together with tumour cells. MiR-1246 was also
found to be the top mutp53-associated miR in a cohort
of 57 human colorectal resected tumours.
Separately, in two lung cancer cohorts, we identified
a signature of microbiome members associated with
p53 mutations. Acidovorax Temperans, a Gram nega-
tive bacterium, was found to be abundant in tumours
of patients with mutant p53. We found a significant
increase in tumour volume in animals inoculated with
Acidovorax temperans as compared to Sham treated
animals, and increased lung weight as a percent of total
body weight. These preliminary data indicate that
Acidovorax temperans contributes to lung tumorigen-
esis in the presence of activated K-Ras and mutant p53.
OMVs

by
Acidovorax

inflammatory signalling in lung carcinoma cells and
elevated CD47 expression on tumour cells and SIRPα

Summary/Conclusion: Altogether, these findings are
consistent with a microenvironmental role for specific
“hot-spot” GOF p53 mutants tightening the interaction
between the tumour cell and the immune compartment
in colon cancer. In both colon and lung cancer, mutant
p53 facilitates cellular interactions within the tumour
microenvironmets mediated by vesicles.

S. oneidensis vesicle loading is driven by BAR domain protein and outer
membrane cytochrome interplay
Lori Zacharoff and Mohamed El-Naggar
University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA
Introduction: The metal respiring bacterium S. onei-
densis creates outer membrane extensions and outer
membrane vesicles that are sculpted by the novel BAR
domain protein BdpA. These vesicles and extensions
incorporate mutliheme cytochromes involved in extra-
cellular electron transfer to metals and electrodes.
However, the physiological relevance of incorporating
these cytochromes into the higher order 3D architec-
ture of a vesicle or extension is unknown. Given that
BAR domains serve as a protein sorting mechanism in
Eukaryotes, we investigated the pathway crosstalk
between BdpA and outer membrane multiheme cyto-
chromes as means to understand the physiological sig-
nificance of membrane architecture.
Methods: o this end, vesicle morphology and content
was measured using dry weights, dynamic light scatter-
ing, fluorescence microscopy and comparative proteo-
mics from wild type S. oneidensis and deletion strains.
Results: Cells lacking BdpA make large amorphous
vesicles that are dense with protein. In contrast, a strain
lacking outer membrane cytochromes recruits less total
protein into smaller vesicles. Proteomics to show that
both BdpA and multiheme cytochromes are involved
in recruiting other proteins to outer membrane vesicles
and have a reciprocal relationship.
Summary/Conclusion: in the absence of BdpA, protein
crowding has to become the main driving force of
vesiculation and BdpA is essential for efficient incor-
poration of cytochromes. However, multiheme cyto-
chromes are not only vesicular cargo, but are also
important for shaping and loading vesicles. Both of
these situations make it clear that vesicles play a role
in increasing the respiratory surface area of S. oneiden-
sis cells. Moving forward, we hope to be able to control
Bdpa and cytochrome levels for selective recruitment of
technologically relevant payloads.

Introduction: Fascioliasis caused by Fasciola hepatica
represents a major economic loss and clinical burden in
cattle farming worldwide. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) con-
tain pathogen-derived molecules that represent novel bio-
markers of disease. In the present study, we have identified
potential new biomarkers of F. hepatica infection in EVs
present in sera of infected cattle.
Methods: Parasites and sera were obtained from local
abattoirs (Valencia, Spain, and Medellin, Colombia,
respectively). 38 sera from infected and 32 from
healthy animals.
Parasites were cultured, and EVs obtained by size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC) and characterized by
NTA, TEM and proteomic profiling.
Recombinant proteins from F. hepatica EVs (enolase
and Fh16.5 tegumentary protein) were produced, and
coupled to magnetic beads. Measurement of bovine
IgG antibodies was performed using Luminex bead
array technology.
Results: A total of 239 proteins were identified associated
with EVs as shown by the presence of typical EV-markers
(Tsg101, Alix, CD63). Two parasite proteins, enolase and
the Fh16.5 tegumentary protein were produced as recom-
binant proteins and used for detection of cattle IgG
employing Luminex bead array technology. Interestingly,
significant differences were found in the fluorescence
values of both recombinant proteins allowing discrimina-
tion between sera from infected and non-infected cattle.
The use of the Fh16.5 protein generated a highly significant
difference between the two groups (p value = 0.003614); as
did enolase (p value was 0.02294).
Summary/Conclusion: This study demonstrates the
usefulness of EV proteins as new biomarkers for early
diagnosis
of
helminth
infections
using
Multiplex
assays, a technology that may also be applied to other
parasite EV molecules.

Introduction: Glycans play an essential role in patho-
gen-host interactions. Larvae and adult worms from
Schistosoma mansoni release distinct subsets of glyco-
conjugates
as
excretory/secretory
(ES)
products.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are also among the ES
products.
We
recently
found
that
schistosomula-
derived EVs are glycosylated and bind human dendritic
cells via C-type lectin receptor (CLR) DC-SIGN, lead-
ing to increased IL-10 and IL-12 release. Here we
investigated the glycosylation profile of EVs released
by S. mansoni adult worms, compared this to schisto-
somula EVs, and addressed how this may affect para-
site-host interactions via CLRs.
Methods: EVs from cultured S. mansoni parasites
were obtained by ultracentrifugation and purified
with iodixanol density gradients. Isolated EVs were
analysed by NTA and cryo EM. N-glycan and lipid
glycan content was determined by mass spectrome-
try. Density gradient fractions with EVs were loaded
onto SDS-page gels followed by Western Blot (WB)
analysis
using
anti-glycan
monoclonal
antibodies
(mAbs).
Results: Cryo EM showed that adult worm EVs lacked
the long thin filaments that are characteristic for schis-
tosomula EVs. Additionally, in contrast to schistoso-
mula EVs, glycolipids could not be detected in the
adult worm EVs. Mass spectrometry analysis showed
that the most abundant N-glycans in the adult worm
EVs contained GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc (LacDiNAc, LDN)
motifs, which correspond to previously published over-
all glycan profiles of this specific life stage. Other dif-
ferences in EV glycosylation between the two life stages
were observed by WB using anti-glycan mAbs: adult
worm EVs showed a paucimannosidic glycan motif
whereas in the schistosomula EVs Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)
GlcNAc (Lewis X) was detected in line with previous
MS analysis.
Summary/Conclusion: The adult worm-derived EVs
contain life stage-specific N-glycans and show a dis-
tinct glycosylation profile compared to the schistoso-
mula EVs. The LDN motifs suggest that adult worm
EVs may interact with the macrophage galactose-type
lectin (MGL) on host cells and most likely have other
immunological consequences than the schistosomula
EV-DC-SIGN interaction.

Introduction: Phloem plays a central role in plant
function, as it is the responsible for the translocation
of photoassimilates from source- to sink-organs, and a
long-distance route for signals distribution. Due to the
sap high nutrient content, sieve elements are primary
target for plant pathogens and pests.
In this work we aimed to isolate and characterize
Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Cucumis melo phloem
sap, derived from plant either exposed or not to the
melon aphid, Aphis gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae).
Methods: Phloem exudates from 5-week-old melon
plants, either uninfested or infested with adults of A.
gossypii (n = 15, 4 replicates each), were collected by
cutting the stem with a sterile razor blade between
first and second expanded leaf from the top. EVs
were isolated by Size Exclusion Chromatography,
and analysed by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
(NTA) and Transmission Electron Microscopy. EVs
proteome
was
determined
by quantitative
mass
spectrometry.
Results: EVs from phloem sap were successfully iso-
lated in every condition. No significant differences
were detected among distinct samples, neither in par-
ticle concentration and size by NTA, nor in protein
concentration.
Most importantly, a total of 381 different proteins
were identified in phloem sap EVs, including 152 pre-
sent in exosome databases (ExoCarta). On top of that,
44 differentially expressed proteins were identified in
EVs derived from aphid infested or uninfested plants
(p value < 0.05).
Summary/Conclusion: Understanding how plants trig-
ger their defences against pests and pathogens is
important to develop new control measures. The
characterization of several proteins in EVs from the
phloem sap provide valuable information on long dis-
tance signalling in plants.
Moreover, as plants lack an immune system com-
parable to animals, the different protein content in
phloem sap EVs after exposure to aphids could indicate
their important role in delivering inducible defences
against invading pests and pathogens.

Introduction: Gastrointestinal nematodes are extre-
mely prevalent parasites that infect most animals and
~24% of human population. Their success as parasites
is attributed to their ability to secrete diverse molecules
that modulate the host immune system. Extracellular
vesicles (EVs) are one of the immune modulatory
compounds they release that directly modulate host
cells. Our goal is to understand how the small RNA
(sRNA) cargo underpins EV function, using a com-
parative analysis of EV cargo from diverse nematode
species.
Methods: We first compared how different EV isola-
tion methodologies (Ultracentrifuge (UC), size fractio-
nation, sucrose gradient floatation) effect the small
RNAs detected in H. bakeri EVs using different library
preparation kits (CleanTag, TruSeq), with or without
polyphosphatase treatment. We then compared this to
small RNA libraries from T. muris EVs using compar-
able methods, UC EV purification, with or without
polyphosphatase treatment and using the CleanTag
library preparation kit.
Results: EVs from both species contained miRNAs,
however the miRNA gene familes in H. bakeri and T.
muris EVs are distinct. The miRNA content detected in
EV samples collected by different purification proto-
cols is robust. The largest difference in detected
miRNAs was found when comparing different library
preparation kits. Although both H. bakeri EVs and T.
muris EVs were dominated by sRNAs derived from
intergenic or repetitive elements in the parasite gen-
omes, only in H. bakeri EVs were these secondary
siRNAs.

Summary/Conclusion: H. bakeri and T. muris EVs con-
tain distinct small RNA cargos, which may underpin
their ability to colonise different host niches, and/or
modulate the host immune system differently. T. muris
EVs do not contain secondary siRNAs, in contrast to H.
bakeri, however they are dominated by sRNAs derived
from intergenic or repetitive regions. Comparative ana-
lysis of helminth EVs could help pinpoint the sRNAs
involved in cross-species communication.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted
from various cells including cancer cells and known to
contain protein and small RNAs including miRNA
isoforms (isomiRs). Therefore we also focused on
isomiRs including other small non-coding RNAs for
biomarker discovery. Although liquid biopsies using
small RNAs are promising biomarkers for early detec-
tion of cancer, current approaches to detecting and
analysing miRNAs in the blood are still inadequate.
Artificial intelligence (AI) data analysis may provide
better algorisms for diagnosing cancer.
Methods: Small RNAs were isolated from serum or
purified EVs using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
and quantified by using the Ion S5™next-generation
sequencing system. (Thermo Fisher Scientific). EVs
were purified using total exosome isolation Reagent
(Invitrogen™). AI data analysis was performed using
JMP® Genomics and DataRobot enterprise AI platform.
Results: Three small RNAs, isomiR of miR-21-5p,
miR-23a-3p, and tRF-Lys (TTT) were significantly
upregulated in breast cancer patients compared with
the healthy cancer-free individual. The combination
algorithm using these three small RNAs allows for a
more accurate diagnosis of the area under the curve
(AUC) 0.92. To test the possibilities that these small
RNAs are derived from cancer cells, we isolated EVs
from the serum and performed NGS analysis to pro-
filed serum small RNAs in EVs. Interestingly we found
that two small RNAs, miR-21-5p and miR-23a-3p, also
high in breast cancer EVs, indicating that these small
RNAs were expected to be derived from cancer cells. In
oesophagus cancer, we also performed NGS analysis
and identified twenty-four miR/isomiRs candidates
for
diagnostic
biomarkers.
A
multiple
regression
model selected miR-30a-5p and two isomiRs (miR-
574-3p and miR-205-5p). The AUC of the panel
index was 0.95. We also performed AI data analysis
and discovered the novel algorisms that can diagnose
breast and oesophagus cancer more accurately.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrated combina-
tions of circulating non-coding RNAs containing EVs
potentially useful for the detection of early-stage breast
and oesophagus cancers. In addition, The DataRobot
enterprise AI platform enables us to the more accurate
diagnosis of cancers at the early stage.

Introduction: Recent findings reveal that extracellular
vesicles (EVs), secreted from cells, are circulating in the
blood. EVs are classified into exosomes (40–120 nm),
microvesicles (50–1,000 nm) and apoptotic bodies
(500–2,000 nm). EVs contain mRNAs, microRNAs,
and DNAs and have the ability to transfer them from

nostic accuracy of tumour cell type-specific EVs as
biomarkers
is
more
than
90%.
In
addition,
microRNAs contained in the EVs are being identified
as specific biomarkers in blood for chemical-induced
inflammation and organ damage.
Therefore,
microRNAs

in
the
EVs
released into the blood from tissues and organs in
response to adverse events such as chemical substances
and medicine are expected to be useful as novel bio-
markers for toxicity assessment. In this study, we
aimed to identify target organs by comprehensive ana-
lysis of EV RNAs in the blood of mice after chemical
exposure
to
establish
a
highly
sensitive
“Next
Generation type” toxicity test for chemical substances
and medicine using EV RNA in blood as a biomarker.
Methods: All animal studies were conducted in accor-
dance with the Helsinki Declaration and the guidelines
approved by the animal care committee of the National
Institute of Health Sciences. C57BL/6 J male mice
(12 weeks) were orally dosed with CCl4 (vehicle, 7,
70 mg/Kg). Serum were separated from blood after 2,
4, 8 and 24 hours after CCl4 administration. The serum
was centrifuged at 10,000 x g to remove cellular debris
and subsequently ultracentrifuged 100,000 x g. The
pellet is resuspended in PBS and ultracentrifuged
100,000 x g again. The comprehensive small RNA-seq
of collected EVs were performed according to the
manufacture’s protocols.
Results: We succeeded in isolating more than 10
novel small RNAs, which could be used as novel
highly sensitive biomarkers for hepatotoxicity due
to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4: 7 mg/Kg & 70 mg/
Kg). Well known hepatotoxicity biomarkers, miRNA-
122 and miRNA-192 were upregulated more than
1000-fold in the administration of 70 mg/Kg CCl4,
but not responded in the administration of 7 mg/Kg
CCl4.
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest that mir-
122 and mir-192 are mainly released from liver to
blood directly only in the administration of 70 mg/Kg
CCl4, while novel more sensitive hepatotoxicity bio-
markers which responded in the administration of both
7 mg/Kg and 70 mg/Kg CCl4 should be included in the
EV. Our novel biomarkers will accelerate a rapid eva-
luation

Introduction: Advancements in sequencing technolo-
gies have allowed analysis of the genomic landscape of
cancer using circulating cell-free(cf) DNA. However,
cfDNA does not originate only from tumour cells.
We recently demonstrated that most of the DNA cir-
culating in plasma of cancer patients is associated with
large EVs (L-EVs), and that L-EV-associated DNA
reflects genomic aberrations of the cells from which
L-EVs arise. Since L-EVs are specifically released by
tumour cells, we explore their potential to report can-
cer-specific genomic alterations in patient plasma and
compare it to cfDNA.
Methods: Differential ultracentrifugation, tunable resistive
pulse sensing, Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay, capil-
lary electrophoresis, whole exome sequencing (1500–
2000x), targeted sequencing (QIAseqTM), flow cytometry.
Results: We show here that L-EVs in the size range of
>1
micrometre are present
exclusively in
plasma
obtained from cancer patients and absent in plasma
from healthy donors. In agreement with this finding,
double-stranded(ds) DNA is detected only in L-EV frac-
tions of patient plasma and not in those obtained from
healthy donor plasma using the same protocol. We also
demonstrate that the fragments of dsDNA associated
with circulating L-EV are larger in comparison with
cfDNA (>10,000 bp versus ~170 bp). A large-scale ana-
lysis of L-EV DNA obtained from plasma of patients
with
metastatic
castration-resistant
prostate
cancer
(mCRPC) as well as with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) demonstrates that DNA associated with circu-
lating L-EVs reports cancer-specific genomic alterations
in both types of cancer. We further investigate if L-EV-
associated DNA is intra- or extravesicular and demon-
strate that it is present in both forms. We finally com-
pare the purity of the tumour signal in intravesicular L-
EV DNA, total L-EV DNA, and cfDNA obtained from
patient plasma.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that
circulating L-EVs contain high quality, large molecular
weight DNA that contains cancer-specific genomic

Detection of EGFR mutations in exosomal RNA and protein mirrors
disease status in metastatic lung cancer patients

Introduction:
Epidermal
growth
factor
receptor
(EGFR) mutation driven lung adenocarcinoma (AC)
represents a unique subgroup that lends itself to treat-
ment with oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Current methods that are used to detect these muta-
tions (e.g. L858 R or the resistance mutation T790 M)
involve invasive tumour biopsies or blood circulating
tumour DNA (ctDNA) and cell free DNA (cfDNA).
The sensitivity of blood ctDNA and cfDNA is limited
by the frequency of genomic alterations in the EGFR
gene; additionally, ctDNA does not reflect changes in
the EGFR protein, against which novel therapies are in
development. There remains a need to develop blood-
based biomarkers that can circumvent these disadvan-
tages and replace the more standard, invasive tumour
biopsies. We propose the study of exosomes for treat-
ment monitoring as well as to identify EGFR resistance
related genomic and proteomic changes.
Methods: We enrolled 10 patients with metastatic lung
AC: 8 with EGFR mutations and 2 without (control).
From the patients with EGFR mutant lung AC, we
processed 25 blood samples through the patients’ treat-
ment course, using ultracentrifugation to isolate exo-
somes. We then used both droplet digital PCR
(ddPCR) to test exosomal RNA (exoRNA) for the
mutation of interest and western blots to test protein
resulting from exon 19 deletion or L858 R mutations.
Results: From 6 patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion
mutations, we detected identical mutations in exoRNA
from 15/19 samples. ExoRNA based mutational load
increased and mirrored clinical progression in 2
patients. Three patients whose cancer remained stable
demonstrated a decrease in their exoRNA. One patient
had blood drawn only at 2 points and was therefore not
plotted. ExoRNA from 2 patients with L858 R and
T790 M mutations demonstrated the corresponding
mutations; however, exoRNA did not mirror their
disease course. We also demonstrated mutant EGFR
protein presence in exosomes from 3 patients. Finally,
we tested cfDNA for EGFR mutations from four
matched samples using ddPCR. We detected matched
mutations in exosomes in all four, while cfDNA muta-
tions were only detected in 2/4 patients.
Summary/Conclusion:
In
summary,
we
detected
EGFR mutations in 19/23 exosome samples isolated
from metastatic lung AC. Our results set the stage for
optimization of exoRNA methods and inform future
experiments relating to exosomal cargo in patients with
EGFR mutant lung AC.

Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the
most malignant and aggressive primary brain cancer in
adults, with an incidence of 3.2 per 100,000 people.
Currently, diagnosis is only performed via histopatho-
logical investigation of a tissue sample from a GBM
lesion, complemented with molecular diagnostics for
identification of select biomarkers. MRI is the standard
of care for follow-up and monitoring of treatment
response. Therefore, development of a “liquid biopsy”
to obtain disease-relevant information from patient’s
body fluids is highly desirable.
Methods: We present the results from a clinical study
in which extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived mRNAs and
long non-coding RNAs were profiled from the plasma
of GBM patients and control individuals. We obtained
plasma from 8 patients at the time of initial diagnosis,
and 8 matched controls by sex and age. EV-associated
RNA was isolated from 1–2 mL plasma and RNA-seq
was
performed
using
our
proprietary
pipeline.
Sequencing data was analysed for differential gene
expression.
Results: We observed 95 mRNAs as differentially
abundant between GBM and control samples, with 82
mRNAs enriched in GBM samples and 13 mRNAs
enriched in control samples (p < 0.05). Correlation
based on differentially abundant mRNAs separated
GBM and control samples into two unique popula-
tions. Eight differentially expressed mRNAs were

potential basis for the further development of a non-

Summary/Conclusion: We have identified a novel RNA
signature for GBM from plasma derived EVs, which
differs from previously identified biomarkers isolated
from tissue. Further work will refine this signature to
enable detection, characterization, and patient monitor-
ing for GBM with minimally invasive techniques.

Introduction: Sjogren’s syndrome (SS) is a systemic
autoimmune disease in which inflammation progres-
sively damages the moisture producing glands of the
afflicted. 4 million Americans are estimated to be suf-
fering from the disease, 90% of which are women with
an average age of 40. Overlapping symptoms with
other health conditions and co-morbidities make SS
particularly difficult to diagnose, with average time to
diagnosis of 3 years. Saliva exosomal RNA profiling has
been primarily focused on small RNAs and has been
limited thus far due to the large contribution of
sequencing reads from the oral microbiome. A non-
invasive saliva exosomal RNA (exoRNA) based test
capable of diagnosis would be highly desirable.
Methods: We began by first developing a novel long
RNA-Seq workflow to selectively enrich and profile
human exosomal mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) from saliva. We then profiled salivary
exoRNA obtained from 7 SS patients and 7 healthy
matched controls. Finally, we performed differential
gene expression analysis to obtain an exoRNA signature
for SS.
Results: RNA-Seq data analysis demonstrated highly
efficient enrichment of human transcriptome, with
over 80% of reads mapping to the transcriptome.
Further RNA biotype analysis showed over 75% of
transcriptome reads mapped to protein coding genes
and lncRNAs. We detected over 10,000 mRNAs and
approx.1000 lncRNAs. Differential expression analysis
(DEx) of SS vs. healthy control exoRNA identified 455
upregulated genes, including 415 mRNAs and 37
lncRNAs (p < 0.05). 120 genes were found to be down-
regulated in SS, including 114 mRNAs and 6 lncRNAs.
Gene ontology analysis of DEx genes revealed enrich-
ment of genes involved in various immune system
related pathways. Most importantly, principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) resulted in clear separation of SS
patients from healthy controls.
Summary/Conclusion: Our optimized RNA-Seq work-
flow enables saliva-based liquid biopsy for biomarker
discovery. The gene signature identified in this ongoing
study could potentially provide a non-invasive molecu-
lar means of diagnosing Sjogren’s syndrome.

Introduction: Increasing embryo implantation rates has
become one of the greatest challenges in assisted repro-
duction techniques. Usually an endometrial biopsy is
done to identify a receptive endometrium, which pre-
vents embryo transfer in the same cycle, as it is detri-
mental for the implantation. The implantation is a
complex process, which requires a synchrony between
the development of the embryo and the endometrium,
but also, an adequate embryo-endometrial cross talk. The
presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as mediators of
this communication has been describe in the endometrial
fluid. Therefore, we hypothesize that the molecular ana-
lysis of the content of the EVs and companion molecules

from endometrial fluid could be a non-invasive method
to recognize an implantative endometrium and conse-
quently improve the implantation rates.
Methods: The objective is to define a simple, sensitive
and reproducible non-invasive EV-based method that
allow the quick identification of an implantative endo-
metrium by means of miRNA analysis. For the establish-
ment of a robust methodology for analysing EVs from
endometrial fluid in clinical settings, where the sample is
limited and no sophisticated equipment is available, five
different methodologies were compared in triplicate.
Two of them consisted in the direct extraction of RNA
while in the other three, before the RNA extraction an
enrichment of EVs was done. SmallRNAseq was per-
formed to determine the most efficient method. Once
the best method was selected, it was applied in a set of
real samples with different implantation outcome. The
content of miRNAs (mainly associated with EVs) of
endometrial fluid samples from women in whom the
implantation was successful (n = 15) and unsuccessful
(n = 15) were analysed.
Results: Our results show that the protocols with a
previous enrichment step of EVs obtained a higher
miRNA expression. The results obtained from the dif-
ferential analysis of the set of samples with different
implantation outcome are being analysed and it is
expected that the results will be available by the time
this communication is presented.
Summary/Conclusion: This work demonstrates that it
is possible to obtain and analyse EVs and EVs-asso-
ciated miRNAs from a small volume of endometrial
fluid samples, which allows the use of EV-miRNAs as a
low-invasive
biomarkers
for
the
detection
of
an
implantative endometrium.

Introduction: Small RNAs are recently reported as a reg-
ulator for prostate cancer progression to castration-resis-
tant disease. Our previous work has shown that EVs
protein cargo is affected by male steroid hormone, dihy-
drotestosterone (DHT). In this study, we assess the small
RNA cargo of EVs in response to androgen manipulations.
Methods: Androgen receptor-positive LNCaPs are
grown in CSS medium to deplete the androgens.
Media were then replaced with vesicle-depleted CSS
medium ± 10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ± 10 µM
Enzalutamide (ENZ) for 48 h. EVs were isolated using
sequential ultracentrifugation (2000 g for 20 min,
10,000 g for 30 min, 100,000 g for 2 h), washed once in
PBS. Protein and RNA were collected from both parent
cells and conditioned medium to allow direct compar-
ison between S-EVs cargo and cells. Small RNA NGS
libraries were prepared using the Illumina’s TruSeq
Small RNA Library Prep kit and single-end sequenced
at a read length of 50 nucleotides (nt). Fastq library files
were processed using a custom-designed pipeline.
Adapters were removed using the Cutadapt tool,
trimmed reads were mapped with high stringency
against ribosomal sequences using Bowtie2. SnoRNA
and
tRNA
fragments
were
identified
using
the
FlaiMapper software. Remaining reads were mapped
against the human genome hg38 using Bowtie2.
Results: We found that the presence or absence of andro-
gens does not significantly change the amount of total
RNA in small EVs (S-EVs). However, hormone stimula-
tion altered the small RNA content of S-EVs, in parallel
with our previous published data on EV protein cargo.
DHT increased the abundance of snoRNA in cells, while
a reduction of snoRNAs was observed in the S-EVs frac-
tion. Interestingly, DHT induced the formation of cell
filopodia that are not inhibited by androgen inhibitor
Enzalutamide.
Pathway
analysis
indicates
the
p53
mediated regulation driven by miRNAs found in S-EVs
upon exposure to DHT. The expression profile of
snoRNA and tRNA fragments in DHT treated cells
resembles results from clinical prostate cancer specimens.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings show that andro-
gen manipulation alters both S-EV derived protein and
RNA cargo. Changes in the S-EV RNA profile due to
treatment with androgens are not identical to small
RNA profiles in parental cells, indicating a specific
sorting mechanism of S-EV small RNA upon androgen
manipulation. Further, DHT induces the formation of
cell filopodia irrespective of Enzalutamide, suggesting
cargo selection of S-EVs. We conclude that small RNA
EV cargo can be utilised to as prostate cancer biomar-
kers in androgen targeted treatments.

Detection of PD-L1 in circulating extracellular vesicles
Veronica Sancheza, Daniel Bachurskib and George Daaboula
aNanoView Biosciences, Boston, USA;
bUniversity of Cologne, Cologne,
Germany
Introduction: Cancer immunotherapy, such as PD-L1
blockade, is a method to eliminate cancer cells. Ectopic
expression of PD-L1, on the surface of tumour cells,
has been associated with tumour persistence and as an
important predictor of therapy response. A test that,
specifically and accurately, detects PD-L1 is critically
important in order to identify patients that would
benefit from these treatments. Emerging evidence has
shown
that
extracellular
vesicles
(EV)
can
carry
immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-L1, and
whose expression have been correlated with tumour
immunity response. With a multitude of commercially
available antibodies identifying appropriate clones and
associated assay is important in order to standardize
the diagnostic modality used.
Methods: PD-L1 expressing cancer cell lines were used
to generate EVs. PD-L1-MYC vector was transfected to
generate an overexpression system. ExoView® sensors
containing different anti-PD-L1 clones were generated.
Samples (cell derived and plasma) were incubated on
chips to allow the antibody to bind the antigen on the
EV. After incubation, chips were immunolabeled with
fluorescently labelled antibodies against PDL-1 or EV
associated markers. ExoView R100 reader was used to
enumerate the EVs captured on the sensor surface and
analyse the expression of PDL-1 on single vesicle
through fluorescence imaging. Immunoprecipitation
and mass spectrometry (IP/MS) were employed as an
orthogonal method to verify the specificity of the assay.
Results: To study the detection efficiency of the anti-
bodies, engineered PD-L1-MYC EVs were used. Under
these circumstances, all the tested antibodies were able
to capture EVs. When testing endogenous PD-L1 posi-
tive EVs from different cancer cell lines, only 28.8 and
73 10 clones consistently bound to EVs. In addition,
EVs derived from plasma demonstrated to be positive
for PD-L1, however, only clone 28.8 was able to immo-
bilize these EVs. The results suggested that clone 28.8
could be a potential PD-L1 antibody to detect PD-L1
positive EVs originating from various sources. To con-
firm these results, and assure the specificity of the
antibody targeted IP/MS was employed.
Summary/Conclusion:
In
combination
with
the
ExoView platform, anti-PD-L1 antibodies can be
screened and potentially used to generate a non-inva-
sive EV-specific assay that could detect this protein in
patients.

Differences in extracellular vesicle protein cargo is dependent on head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma cell of origin
Heather M. Walline and Chrissy Goudsmit
University of Michigan, Ann Arbour, USA
Introduction: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) is the sixth most common, eighth most fatal
cancer worldwide and includes cancers of the orophar-
ynx, larynx, hypopharynx, and oral cavity. In 2017,
there were over 49,000 new cases and 9,700 deaths
estimated in the USA alone. Despite recent advances
in treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, sur-
gery, concurrent chemoradiation, and immunotherapy,
many
tumours
develop
resistance
and
progress.
Patients develop metastases or tumours recur locally
or regionally; the 5-year overall survival rate for
HNSCC is only 40–50%. Factors that contribute to
poor survival for patients with HNSCC include late
stage diagnosis, lack of reliable markers for early stage
detection, high level of biologic heterogeneity, and local
recurrence and distant metastases after treatment.
Methods: This study used 8 representative HPV-posi-
tive and HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines, one HPV-
transformed cell line. and two non-cancer oral kerati-
nocyte cell lines. EVs were isolated using differential

ultracentrifugation and PEG precipitation/ultracentri-
fugation. EVs were characterized by TEM, NTA, and
Wes protein analysis for reported EV markers. EV and
whole cell lysates were assessed by LC-MS/MS analysis
using the Tandem Mass Tag-10plex kit. Cluster analy-
sis was performed on the fold-change peptide spectrum
matches (PSM) for the EVs from the HNSCC lines
compared to the EVs from the normal keratinocyte
line (NOKsi). Protein was measured using a capillary-
based electrophoresis instrument.
Results: CD9 and AnnexinV were detected in all of the
EV lysates tested, while Calnexin was detected in all of
the whole cell lysates and none of the EV samples
tested. Selected proteins STAT3, HLA-A, Tenascin, E-
Cadherin, β Catenin, Cytokeratin 19, EPHA2, and
CD59, and HPV-related markers p16, p53, RB, Cyclin
D1, and EGFR were tested using the WES platform.
EVs from HPV-positive cell lines showed higher pro-
tein levels compared to EVs from HPV-negative cell
lines in STAT3, HLA-A, and Tenascin. Only KERT19
demonstrated lower protein levels in EVs from HPV-
negative cell lines. Of the common HPV-associated
HNSCC markers: EGFR, p53, RB, Cyclin D1 and p16,
only EGFR was positive in any the EVs tested. The
remaining proteins queried, E-Cadherin, β Catenin,
EPHA2 and CD59 showed varying protein levels in
EVs from both HPV positive and HPV-negative cell
lines.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings suggest that these
proteins may be potential HNSCC EV markers that
may be 1) selectively included in EV cargo for export
from the cell as a strategy for metastasis, tumour cell
survival, or modification of tumour microenvironment,
or 2) representative of originating cell composition,
which may be developed for diagnostic or prognostic
use in clinical liquid biopsy applications.

Validation of antibodies on western blot for extracellular vesicles from
biological human samples and cancer cell conditioned media

The Brady Urological Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Baltimore, USA
Introduction:
One
of
the
major
challenges
in
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) research is to prove the
particles that are isolated are true EVs, rather than
other
co-isolated
contaminants,
like
lipoproteins.
ISEV recommends using multiple assays to character-
ize EVs. This study aims to validate the positive and
negative protein markers for extracellular vesicles from
plasma, urine and prostate cancer cell conditioned
media (CCM).
Methods: Membrane and cytosolic fractions of MCF7 cells
served as positive and negative controls for all antibodies
validated. EVs were isolated from plasma of healthy volun-
teers, urine of healthy volunteers and CCM of PC-3 cells
using differential ultracentrifugation. Eight protein mar-
kers were assessed: positive markers CD63, CD81, CD9,
Flotillin1 (Flot1), Alix and Tumour susceptibility gene 101
(TSG101), negative marker calnexin (CANX), and con-
taminant markers Apo-A1 for plasma and THP for urine.
Tetraspanins are small transmembrane proteins expressed
in EVs. Flot1 is membrane protein that forms microdo-
mains in the plasma. Alix and TSG101, an accessory pro-
tein of the endosomal sorting complex required for
transport, are involved in the biogenesis of EVs. They are
positive markers for EVs. CANX is in the membrane of the
endoplasmic reticulum. Apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1) is
the protein components of lipoproteins, therefore it is
marker of contamination for Plasma EV. Tamm-Horsfall
protein (THP) is contamination marker for Urine EV,
because it is most abundant protein in human urine.
Results: All antibodies were validated in the correct
positive and negative control, thus confirmed as usable
and reliable antibodies for Western Blot. In Plasma EV,
CD63, CD9, CD81 and Flot1 were positive and CANX
and Apo-A1 were negative. In Urine EVs, CD9, CD63,
Flot-1, Alix and TSG101 were positive and CANX and
THP were negative. In CCM EVs, CD9, CD63, Flot1,
Alix and TSG101 were positive and CANX was
negative.
Summary/Conclusion: We confirmed a high degree of
EV purity from 3 sample types: urine, plasma, and
CCM. Of particular importance, we confirmed that
EVs isolated from biologic patient samples, plasma
and urine, had low contamination. Future work will
use these methods to confirm purity of EV samples
prior to addition analysis, such as examining EV cargo
and biologic significance.

Introduction: The project we are working on is to
modify the immunogenic profile of human CMMs
from the umbilical cord stroma through its stable
transfection with anti-miR-21-5p, and therefore of the
exosomes that these cells generate, for use in free-cell
therapy to treat inflammatory process.
Methods: EVs released from a primary culture of
human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and
from
primary
culture
of
human
umbilical
cord
mesenchymal stem cells miR21-/- modified through
stable lentiviral transfection were isolated by ultracen-
trifugation processes, characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and measured by nanopar-
ticles tracking analysis (NTA). Protein extraction from
EVs was made using RIPA buffer and after checking
protein integrity the total EV proteins. We performed a
shotgun proteomic study using a TMT (10-plex) label
of the total miR21-/- exosomes protein comparing it
with normal exosomes. After labelling the LTQ-
Orbitrap platform of ProteoRed was needed for frac-
tion
injections
and
data
acquisition.
Proteome
Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo) was used for protein proces-
sing and quantification.
Results: A total of 1.861 proteins were identified at
least with a unique peptide and we have able to estab-
lish the proteomic profile of miR21-/- exosomes
against normal exosomes. We found out several pro-
tein modulated by miR21 and related to inflammation.
Summary/Conclusion: We have able to establish the
proteomic profile of miR21-/- exosomes against nor-
mal exosomes focusing on proteins involving inflam-
mation process. All those results seem indicate that
exosomes could be modified, which could be used as
an anti-inflammatory free-cell therapy.

Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the
6th most common cancer worldwide and the 3rd most
common cause of cancer death; additionally, its incidence
is increasing. While outcomes for early HCC are superior
to those for late stage disease, early detection of HCC
remains a challenge. Current guidelines have suboptimal
sensitivity and specificity. In this pilot study, we hypothe-
size that urine extracellular vesicles (EVs) may identify
candidate biomarkers towards the development of an
inexpensive, widely accessible screening assay for the
early detection of HCC.
Methods: Urine samples from 20 healthy subjects, 19
subjects with cirrhosis, and 19 subjects with cirrhosis
plus
HCC
were
collected
and
processed
using
YMATRIX columns to isolate EV-associated protein
and miRNA. Protein was analysed using a tandem
mass tag method on a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap
Fusion mass spectrometer with Comet/PAWS and
EdgeR processing. miRNA was analysed using a tar-
geted Firefly microarray from Abcam. Differential
expression and predictive modelling for the presence
of HCC and cirrhosis was performed to identify candi-
date miRNA and protein biomarkers.
Results: For miRNA, 39 samples were eligible for analysis
after low expression filtering. We used pair-wise ratios of
34 cancer-associated miRNAs by gradient boosting of
decision trees to develop a predictive model for HCC.
Our best model had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.93
and 0.92 respectively using 6 miRNAs to distinguish
HCC from cirrhosis. All samples were eligible for protein
analysis. Based on differential expression and biologic
relevance, we identified 10 protein candidate biomarkers.
Interestingly, we found liver-selective proteins and known
HCC/cirrhosis
plasma/tissue
markers,
demonstrating
proof-of-concept for the method.
Summary/Conclusion:
Urine
extracellular
vesicles
contain liver-selective proteins and known liver disease
serum biomarkers as well as novel miRNA and protein
biomarkers that are significantly up-regulated in dis-
ease samples. The described candidate biomolecules
may be easily accessible biomarkers with which to
develop a sensitive and specific universal screening
diagnostic for the early detection of cirrhosis and HCC.

Introduction: Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs)
are known to carry biologically active molecules
which contribute to homoeostatic and pathologic func-
tions. EVs and their cargo have been associated with
the development and perpetuation of autoimmune (AI)
diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Understanding
the content of EVs and how they correlate with disease
state, activity, and response to therapy could provide a
valuable tool for patient tailoring in AI diseases.
Methods: Samples were collected after independent
review board approval and patient informed consent
was obtained. EVs were isolated from EDTA plasma
from patients with RA (n = 20) or SLE (n = 20) and
from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 20).
EV
size
and
concentration
were
assessed
by
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), miRNA con-
tent by NanoString, and protein content by Luminex
41-plex Immunoassay.
Results: NTA revealed a higher concentration of EVs in
RA (p = 0.042), but not SLE (p = 0.278) plasma com-
pared to healthy controls. Additionally, the size of EVs
from RA and SLE samples compared to those of healthy
controls were significantly larger (p = 0.0074 and
p = 0.0004, respectively). Analysis of miRNA identified
differential expression of 8 and 11 miRNA in RA and
SLE EVs, respectively, compared to healthy controls. All
8 species that changed in RA EVs were also differentially
expressed in SLE EVs. Furthermore, when we analysed
the protein content, we found that 2 proteins in RA EVs
and 4 proteins in SLE EVs were differentially expressed
compared to healthy control EVs. Of these analytes,
MDC was downregulated in EVs from both RA and
SLE samples compared to those of healthy controls
(p = 0.04 and p = 0.0004, respectively).
Summary/Conclusion: Plasma EVs from patients with RA
and SLE displayed altered size, miRNA and protein content
compared to EVs from healthy controls. Additional ana-
lyses, correlating findings with disease metrics, will be
performed and may reveal biomarkers with relevance to
clinical outcomes. Identification and analysis of EVs circu-
lating in patients with AI diseases may present a new
paradigm for future biomarker strategies.

Introduction:
The
peptidergic
G-protein
coupled
receptors (GPCRs) are cell-signalling transmembrane
proteins, which in their native form comprise of seven
segments embedded in the cell membrane. This struc-
tural advancement is believed to be maintained in
extracellular vesicles (EVs). In autoimmune diseases,
the presence of autoantibodies towards GPCRs is not
uncommon, and to detect plasma autoantibodies, EVs
carrying GPCR will be used as template in a novel
microarray screening tool.
Methods: Purified EVs from HEK293 cells were
printed on different types of surfaces; polymer coated
glass slides and hydrophilic and hydrophobic plastic 96
well plates. Five different print buffers were tested in a
multiplex assays. Spots containing EVs were stained
with
biotinylated
antibodies
(CD9,
CD63,
CD81,
ADRβ2, Hsp70, EPCAM and Flotilin-1) followed by
binding of Cy5-labelled streptavidin and visualized
microarray scanner.
Results: The outcome of these experiments was pro-
mising, as some of the chosen printing buffers showed
increased tendencies to bind EVs. The EV presence was
verified with a panel of markers known to be present
on small EVs. In addition, the EV content of the
adrenergic beta-2 receptor (ADRβ2-receptor), which
is a GPCR of interest in autoimmune diseases, was
verified in some of the experimental setups.
Summary/Conclusion: The approach of using EVs as
template in a screening tool possesses the potential to
easily screen for autoimmune illness markers in diag-
nostic purposes. Using the microarray technology
allows the screening to be multivariate, specific and
highly sensitive.

uEVs, little is known about its collection time and
normalization approach. The majority of the studies
on uEVs focus on spot urine collection based on the
assumption that it accurately reflects the renal func-
tion, although time point of collection is not standar-
dized. Therefore the practice to collect spot urine does
not allow for calculating and standardizing accurately
the uEV excretion rate which may vary during the day.
In addition, no research has been carried out yet to
show the quantitative and qualitative difference of
uEVs between spot urine and 24 h collections.The
aim of this study is to compare uEVs excreted in all
single voids during a 24 hour collection period and
compare it with 24 hour collection performed.
Methods: uEVs were enriched by differential centrifu-
gation and electron microscopy, western blot, nanopar-
ticle tracking analysis, tuneable resistive pulse sensing
and imaging flow cytometry were used to quantify
uEVs and associated markers variation during the 24
hour. Creatinine, urine osmolality and particle concen-
tration were used to normalize the assessed analytes.
Results: Electron microscopy showed a heterogeneous
population of EVs and western blot confirmed the
presence of EV markers (TSG101, ALIX and CD9).
RNA
was
extracted
by
a
column-based
method
(miRNA extraction kit Qiagen) and cel-39 miRNA
was spiked in each sample. A multiparametric detec-
tion of nephron markers podocalyxin, aquaporin-2 and
uEVs pan tetraspanins (CD9 + DC63 + CD81) was
performed utilizing imaging flow cytometry. Whereas
the uEV composition did not change across the
24 hours analysis, the quantity of uEVs and related
markers fluctuated during the day depending on the
hydration and excretion rate.The results of a 24 hour
urine collection reflected the average results of all sin-
gle voids over a 24 hr period. Creatinine and particle
count normalization failed to normalize “outliers”.
Summary/Conclusion: This study represents the very
first report which compares single void urine versus 24
hour uEV analysis. We concluded that the 24 hour
collection is the preferred choice for a robust and rigor-
ous assessment of uEVs and its associated markers.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released
from cells to body fluids are extensively studied as
potential carriers of nucleic acid and protein biomar-
kers, particularly in cancer research. Our aim was to
compare small EV content in body fluids of the bio-
medical porcine model to assess their suitability for
subsequent proteomic analyses.
Methods: Small extracellular vesicles were enriched
from freshly collected porcine blood (plasma), cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) and semen by ultracentrifugation.
Size, quantity and quality of isolated particles were
characterized by transmission electron microscopy,
flow cytometry and western blots. Protein composition
of seminal plasma-derived vesicles was analysed using
LC-MS/MS (tripleTOF with SWATH quantification).
Results: Seminal plasma yielded twice the number of
small EVs than the blood plasma. Approximately
13times less EVs were obtained from CSF compared
to seminal plasma. Proteomic analysis of seminal
plasma EVs resulted in approx. 1500 identified proteins
including proteins involved in exosome biogenesis and
transport (74 of the 100 most frequently identified
proteins in EVs according to Exocarta database).
Summary/Conclusion: Porcine seminal and blood
plasma (single ml volumes) are reasonable sources of
EVs for proteomic analyses. In contrast, EV counts in
CSF are very low. Techniques for the EV enrichment
and proteomic analysis implemented in this study may
be applied to biomarker discovery in porcine model of
diseases as well as adopted to other species, including
human.

Introduction: Macrophages contribute to therapy inef-
ficiency in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
possible through secretion of extracellular vesicles
(EVs). We aimed to understand the impact of EVs
released by macrophages on PDAC cellular response
to gemcitabine (GEM) and to identify novel targets for
therapeutic intervention.
Methods: EVs released by polarized pro-inflammatory
or
anti-inflammatory
macrophages,
derived
from
human healthy blood donors, were isolated by differ-
ential
centrifugation.
EVs
were
characterized
by
Nanoparticle
Tracking
Analysis,
Transmission
Electron Microscopy and Western Blot. Response to
GEM was analysed in PDAC cells with or without
prior co-culture with EVs, using SRB assay. Protein
content of EV’s cargo was assessed by proteomic ana-
lysis.
Potential
candidates
interfering
with
GEM
response were identified and confirmed using human
recombinant proteins (rh) or specific pharmacological
inhibitors. In addition, tissue samples from 3 meta-
static PDAC and from healthy non-pathological tissues
were immunohistochemically stained for the identified
proteins, as well as for CD68, a macrophage lineage
marker. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database, we assessed the association of the identified
candidates with the overall survival of 176 PDAC
patients.
Results: Our results showed that large EVs (10 k-
centrifugation pellet) shed by the distinctly polarized
macrophages decreased BxPC3 PDAC cellular sensi-
tivity to GEM, in an EVs-concentration dependent
manner. Proteomic analysis of those EVs identified
Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) and Fibronectin (FN) as
one of the most abundant proteins. Both EVs and
rhCHI3L1 or rhFN induced GEM resistance, invol-
ving
the
ERK
signalling
pathway.
Moreover,
Pentoxyfilline and Pirferidone, two FDA-approved
drugs inhibitors of CHI3L1 and FN, respectively,
increased
PDAC
cellular
sensitivity
to
GEM.
Immunohistochemistry data confirmed that CHI3L1
and FN are expressed in the stroma of human PDAC
tumour
samples,
associated
to
the
presence
of
macrophages, and have no relevant expression in
healthy pancreas. Using TCGA, we also found an
association between CHI3L1 and FN gene expression
with PDAC patients’ overall survival, response to
GEM and macrophage infiltration.
Summary/Conclusion: This work highlights the rele-
vance of EVs shed by human macrophages to GEM
response and identified CHI3L1 and FN as potential
therapeutic targets in PDAC.

In vivo derived bovine blastocyst secrete different population of extra-
cellular vesicles compared to vitro produced counterparts

Lleretny Rodriguez-Alvarez
Universidad de Concepcion, Chillan, Chile
Introduction: In vitro produced (IVP) bovine embryos
secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in
cell communication. Cargo and characteristics of EVs
(size mean: SM, size mode; SMo and concentration: C)
vary during preimplantation development according to
the origin and competence of embryos. In vivo pro-
duced (IVV)
embryos
have
better developmental
potential than IVP. Here we aim to evaluate if IVV
embryos secrete different population of EVs compared
to IVP counterparts.
Methods: For IVV embryos, heifers were superovu-
lated
and
inseminated
with
commercial
semen.
Embryos were recovered at morula stage and cultured
individually in EVs depleted media (DOFd) until day7.
IVP embryos were produced by in vitro fertilization
and cultured in groups (25 zygote per well) until mor-
ula stage, at this point were cultured further individu-
ally in SOFd. At day 7, all embryos were classified
according to developmental stage and culture media
(CM) were collected from embryos that reached the
blastocyst stage. Blastocysts were transferred to fresh
media until day 11 to assess their post-hatching com-
petence. CM from competent embryos, (diameter >
270 μm) were used for EVs analysis (IVV: n = 26;
IVP: n = 30). EVs were analysed using NTA. Data
were analysed by Wilcoxon test or Pearson correlation.
Statistic signification for p < 0.05.
Results: At day 7 IVV embryos had a greater diameter
than IVP (IVV: 190.7 μm; IVP: 165.7 μm; p < 0.05).
However, IVP embryos reached a bigger diameter at
day 11 (IVV: 289.9 μm; IVP: 381.9 μm; p < 0.05).
Isolated particles from CM of both groups were classi-
fied as EVs by their morphology using TEM and by the
expression of surface markers CD9, CD63 and CD81.
EVs parameters for IVV were: SM = 149.6 nm;
SMo = 116.4, C = 1.2 x108xml while for IVV:
SM = 124.7 nm; SMo = 93.5 and C = 1.5x108xml.
Both SM and SMo were statistically different between
groups. Also SM and SMo positively correlate with
embryo diameter at day 7.
Summary/Conclusion: IVV embryos secrete bigger
EVs than IVP, what may point to a higher competence
of in vivo derived embryos. This coincides with our
previous finding that competent IVP embryos secret
bigger EVs compare to non-competent IVP embryos
(Mellisho et al., 2019).

communication

Sciences, Olsztyn, Poland
Introduction: Behind the beauty of each pregnancy,
stands an incredible complexity. The most critical
stage of the pregnancy, unfortunately marked by a
high rate of pregnancy loss, is the embryo implanta-
tion. Its success depends on a proper embryo develop-
ment
synchronised
with
timely
acquired
uterine
receptivity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered
now as important players in embryo-maternal commu-
nication. Despite the ongoing effort, still little is known
about precise role of EVs in modulation of embryo-
maternal milieu. Thus, the overarching aim of this
study was to determine the effect of the delivery of
uterine EVs to primary porcine trophoblast (pTr)
cells in vitro.
Methods: Several methods (e.g., Western blot, NTA)
were used to characterize EVs isolated from porcine
uterine lumen during early pregnancy (day [D] 12 and
D16). TaqMan Array Cards were applied to profile
miRNAs carried by uterine EVs. Ingenuity Pathway

Analysis tools were used to identify in silico biological
pathways and functions governed by detected miRNAs.
Expression of putative targets of selected miRNAs was
tested using qPCR after in vitro delivery of uterine EVs
to pTr cells.
Results: Careful characterisation confirmed that uter-
ine lumen is enriched with a diverse population of EVs
caring miRNAs. Interestingly, 36 out of 79 detected
miRNAs showed difference in abundance between
tested days of pregnancy and half of them was exclu-
sively detected on D16. Identified miRNAs were char-
acterized as potent regulators of cellular development,
growth, proliferation, and movement, in addition to
their involvement in organismal and embryonic devel-
opment. The expression of 20 genes identified as a
possible miRNA targets was tested after EVs delivery
to pTr cells in vitro. Both down- (e.g., PTGER4) and
up-regulated (e.g., LIFR) genes were found (p < 0.05);
involved in the same molecular and cellular functions
enriched by detected miRNAs.
Summary/Conclusion: Uterine lumen is enriched with
EVs transporting miRNAs, which may have an impact
on proper embryo development and implantation. In
addition, delivery of uterine EVs to the trophoblast
cells affect the expression of miRNA targets involved
in embryo-maternal communication. Altogether, these
results show an important role of EVs and their cargo
during early pregnancy in pigs.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging
as important players in cell to cell communication in
reproductive systems. Notably, EVs have been found
and characterized in the male reproductive tract, how-
ever direct functional evidence for their importance in
mediating sperm function is lacking. We have pre-
viously demonstrated that Arrdc4, a member of the
alpha-arrestin protein family, is involved in EV biogen-
esis and release. Here we show that Arrdc4-mediated
EV biogenesis is required for proper sperm function.
Methods: EVs were harvested from wild type and
Arrdc4-/- epididymal cells using differential ultracentri-
fugation, then characterised using Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Sperm
motility was measured using Computer assisted sperm
analysis and ImageJ. Fertilisation capacity was measured
using the following assays: Capacitation-associated tyro-
sine phosphorylation, calcium ionophore induced acro-
some reaction, Zona pellucida binding assay and In vitro
fertilization with time-lapse imaging of embryo develop-
ment. Immunohistochemistry was also used to visualise
two pronuclei formation and blastocyst morphology.
Arrdc4-/- sperm was supplemented with wild type EVs
in the above assays to assess whether they could restore
function.
Results: Sperm from Arrdc4-/- mice develop normally
through the testis but fail to acquire adequate motility
and fertilization capabilities through the epididymis, as
evidenced by reduced motility, premature acrosome
reaction, reduction in zona pellucida binding and pro-
duction of two-cell embryos. We observed a significant
reduction in EV production by Arrdc4-/- epididymal
epithelial cells, and addition of wild type EVs to
Arrdc4-/- sperm dampens the acrosome reaction and
restores zona pellucida binding.
Summary/Conclusion:
These
results
indicate
that
Arrdc4 is important for proper sperm maturation
through the control of extracellular vesicle biogenesis.

Maternal EV-derived myomiRs are associated with the development of
large-for-gestational age babies in pregnancies complicated by gestational
diabetes

Introduction: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is among the
most common pregnancy complications. Despite treat-
ment, up to 25% of pregnancies complicated by GDM
result in infants being born large-for-gestational-age
(LGA). This not only causes problems at birth but pre-
disposes offspring to developing cardio-metabolic dis-
ease in adulthood. There are no treatments for LGA as
the cause is unclear, although it is associated with altered
placental vascular development. microRNAs (miRNAs)
regulate placental development; they are produced
within cells but can be released into the circulation
inside EVs, which in turn can be transported into target
cells and tissues to influence cellular processes.

We aimed to characterise circulating EVs in preg-
nancies complicated by GDM-LGA and determine if
EV-derived miRNAs have the potential to influence
placental development.
Methods: Maternal serum and plasma samples were
collected from women with pregnancies complicated
by GDM at 24–32 weeks gestation; placental tissue
was collected at delivery and birth outcomes recorded.
Serum and plasma EVs were isolated and characterised
by electron microscopy (shape), nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA; size/concentration), and Western blot-
ting (EV-enriched proteins). miRNA QPCR arrays
were performed on EVs. miRNAs were quantified in
placental tissue via QPCR.
Results: EM and Western blotting confirmed isolation of
EVs and NTA revealed no significant difference in size/
concentration in GDM-LGA pregnancies (n = 7) com-
pared to GDM-AGA (n = 13; p > 0.05). Several EV
miRNAs were altered in maternal circulation in GDM-
LGA compared to GDM-AGA (n = 7/group; >twofold-
change; p < 0.05), including four skeletal muscle-specific
“myomiRs”: miR-1-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, and miR-
499a-3p (all increased). All four myomiRs were present in
placenta but only miR-1-3p was significantly altered in
GDM-LGA compared to GDM-AGA (n = 12–14/group;
p < 0.05).
Summary/Conclusion:
EV-bound
myomiRs
could
have predictive value for aberrant foetal growth in
cases of GDM. miR-1-3p regulates vascular develop-
ment in other systems, so we propose that miR-1-3p
contributes to LGA by influencing placental vascular
development, however further work is required to
establish this.

Introduction: Seminal plasma is particularly rich in
extra cellular vesicles. Myelinosomes are membra-
nous organelles described throughout the seminifer-
ous epithelium of the testis but never reported in
semen. The aim of this study was to look for the
presence of myelinosome vesicles in human seminal
plasma.
Methods: Because of the viscosity of seminal gel and its
water-holding capacity, classical transmission electron
microscopy does not seem to be an optimal technique
to reveal the presence of myelinosomes in this fluid.
Cryo-electron microscopy is a technique that allows
visualization of nanosized structures without prior fixa-
tion or addition of heavy metals for contrast. The
sample is therefore visualized as close to its native
state as possible. Using standard myelinosome prepara-
tion from TM4 Sertoli cells, we first analysed the
appearance of “standard” native myelinosomes by
cryo EM and then compared it with the vesicles from
human seminal plasma samples.
Results: We have specified by cry-EM the morpholo-
gical aspect of “standard” myelinosomes isolated from
the culture media of TM4 Sertoli cells. The vesicles
with the same morphological appearance were revealed
in human seminal plasma specimens.
Summary/Conclusion: Myelinosomes are membra-
nous organelles found in the seminiferous epithelium
of the testis and secreted by the somatic Sertoli cells
in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules.The pre-
parations from human seminal plasma contains a
population of large EV (average diameter 200 nm)
whose morphological appearance resemble those of
myelinosomes. Defining the specific biomarkers and
functionalities of myelinosomes in human seminal
plasma are the concerns to be addressed in our
further research.

Tuberous sclerosis complex axis controls extracellular vesicles production
and protein content

Introduction: More than one million patients world-
wide suffer from tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and
have mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Together,
the TSC proteins regulate mTORC1 activity. All TSC
patient post-mortem samples exhibit renal disease and
40% of patients with TSC experience a premature loss of
renal function. Mouse and human studies are incongru-
ity with the second somatic hit mechanism of disease,
because of the low percentage of cystic cells exhibiting
loss of TSC expression. We posited that the loss of a TSC
protein expression may alter extracellular vesicle (EV)
biology and contribute to disease.
Methods: We used CRISPR/CAS9 to disrupt the Tsc2
gene
in
mouse
inner
medullary
collecting
duct
(mIMCD) cells, and isolated EVs using gel filtration
from the isogenic cell lines. We characterized the EVs
using tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), dynamic
light scattering (DLS), transition electron microscopy
(TEM), and wester blot analysis. We further performed
mass spectroscopy on the EV proteins.
Results: Loss of the Tsc2 gene in mIMCD cells induced
a greater than three-fold increase in EV production
compared to the same cells having an intact Tsc axis.
Electron microscopy confirmed the purity and spheri-
cal shape of EVs. Both TRPS and DLS demonstrated
that the isolated EVs possessed a heterogenous size
distribution. Approximately 90% of the EVs were in
the 100–250 nm size range. Western blot analysis using
proteins isolated from the EVs revealed the cellular
proteins Alix and TSG101, the transmembrane proteins
CD63, CD81 and CD9, and the primary cilia-related
Hedgehog
signalling-related
proteins
Arl13b.
Proteomic analysis of EVs identified a significant dif-
ference between the Tsc2-intact and Tsc2-deleted cells
that correlated well with the increased production.
Summary/Conclusion: EVs may be involved in tissue
homoeostasis and cause disease by overproduction and
altered protein content. The EVs released by renal cyst
epithelia in TSC complex may serve as a tool to dis-
cover the mechanism of TSC cystogenesis and in devel-
oping potential therapeutic strategies.

Introduction: We have shown that EVs derived from
amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC) of mouse origin pre-
sent therapeutic effect in an animal model of chronic
kidney disease, Alport Syndrome (AS). In light of clin-
ical translation, we isolated AFSC-EVs of human ori-
gin, characterized their cargo and evaluated thier
therapeutic effect in vivo.
Methods: Human clonal AFSC were derived from
amniotic fluid collected after volunteer donors provided
consent. EVs were obtained from AFSC and identity and
purity were assessed by RNA-seq and proteomics.
Potency of hAFSC-EVs was evaluated by performing
in vivo studies. EV biodistribution was evaluated by
MRI and therapeutic effect by measuring renal function
and mice life-span. Bulk RNA-seq was performed on
glomeruli obtained from injected and non-injected mice
to identify potential EV regulating targets.
Results: Proteomic profiling identified 675 intact pro-
teins and RNA-seq data identified 2,535 miRs in
hAFSC-EVs. hAFSC-EV “fingerprint” was assessed by
performing GO analysis on the 100 most highly
expressed proteins and miRs. The results identified

showed that hAFSC-EVs localized in the kidney, cor-
rected proteinuria. No side effects (including teratoma)
were noted in the treated mice. RNA-seq of glomeruli
obtained from treated AS mice showed similar gene
expression patterns to wilt type mice, by cluster analy-
sis. Our data indicated that hEVs highly modulated
pathways involved in collagen and matrix deposition
remodelling, in addition to downstream targets of
VEGF, FGF, TNF, angiotensin and preserved glomer-
ular cells structure and function.
Summary/Conclusion: Our protocol for hEVs deriva-
tion is reproducible and allows derivation of EV lots
with the same identity (specific cargo of proteins and
miRs) and potency (present therapeutic effect in AS).
hAFSC-EVs modulated signalling pathways that are

A millifluidic in vitro model of glomerular filtration to test the regen-
erative effect of extracellular vesicles under dynamic conditions
Linda Bellucci and Benedetta Bussolati
University of Torino, Torino, Italy
Introduction: Recent studies have shown that stem
cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EV) therapy
improves renal outcomes in models of acute ad chronic
renal disease. However, to better investigate the mole-
cular mechanisms of EV-induced regeneration, and to
define new EV sources, devices that mimic 3D organ
architecture and flow conditions are needed. The aim
of our work is to evaluate the regenerative potential of
naïve and engineered EV in a millifluidic in vitro 3D
model of glomerular damage in continuous perfusion.
Methods: Methods: we set a millifluidic in vitro 3D
model of glomerular filtration, a three-layers structure
composed
by
human
podocytes
and
glomerular
endothelial cells, and, in between, of a basement mem-
brane of Collagen type IV. The barrier thus formed is
set up inside a bioreactor, in a closed milli-fluidic
circuit in which fluid flows continuously at a certain
flow rate. We reproduced different pathological condi-
tions and tested the localization and effect of EVs in a
dynamic system.
Results: Results: we obtained a standardized protocol
and an adequate configuration of the milli-fluidic cir-
cuit subject to continuous reperfusion. Renal damage
was induced by doxorubicin or by hypoxia-reperfusion
injury. We evaluated uptake, cargo transfer and effect
of naïve and miRNA engineered MSC-EVs or of
Klotho engineered ineffective EVs administered into
the dynamic co-culture system. EVs were able to pass
through the system and to deliver to podocytes pro-
regenerative factors, promoting survival and limiting
permeability.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, we highlighted
the effects of MSC naive EVs as well as of engineered
EVs in a model of glomerular damage under EV con-
tinuous perfusion.

Introduction: Worldwide, renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
is 8th most common cancer in men and 10th most
common in women. New biomarkers are needed to aid
RCC-diagnosis, provide prognostic information, and to
predict
response
to
modern
targeted
therapies.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are an emerging source of
cancer biomarkers because all cells, including cancer
cells, secrete EVs into biofluids as blood and urine.
However, benign cells contribute to EV populations
isolated from blood and urine reducing the disease-
specificity. We have developed a protocol for EV iso-
lation directly from human RCC tissue that can
increase tumour-specificity of biomarkers.
Methods: We obtained technical and biological repli-
cates from normal kidney tissue and clear cell RCC
tissue. Serum-free media was incubated with the speci-
mens. A combination of differential centrifugation,
filtration, and ultracentrifugation was used for EV iso-
lation. EVs were quantitated using two methods, allow-
ing for comparison between NanoSight NS300 and
NanoFCM. TEM was used to determine presence of
intact vesicles in the EV samples. Presence of EV

protein markers (CD81, CD63, flotillin-1), and absence
of cellular debris (calnexin), were assessed using
Western Blot.
Results: Particle concentrations for the technical repli-
cates of normal kidney EVs were 1.44 × 1010 ± 2.51 x
109 p/mL (mean ± SD) measured by NanoSight, and
1.67 × 1010 ± 6.89 x 109 p/mL (mean ± SD) measured
by NanoFCM. Vesicle concentrations for replicates
RCC EVs were 1.80 × 1010 ± 3.59 x 109 p/mL (mean
± SD) measured by NanoSight and 1.68 × 1010 ± 4.18 x
109 p/mL (mean ± SD) measured by NanoFCM.
Among different patients, we observed an acceptable
biological variance in EV counts. A head-to-head com-
parison of NanoSight and NanoFCM demonstrated
differences in total particle counts of less than fivefold.
NanoFCM performed better in measuring particle size
distribution. Small EVs were visible on TEM images in
all technical and biological replicates. EV markers were
positive in all samples and calnexin was negative.
Summary/Conclusion: We optimized EV isolation from
RCC tissue and normal kidney. The product of our
protocol contains small EVs in high abundance. The
protocol can contribute to study tumour microenviron-
ment and biomarker discovery in kidney cancer.

Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a lethal
urological
cancer
with
an
incidence
rate
which
accounts for about 3% of all human cancers. Nearly
40% of RCC patients are diagnosed with either locally
invasive or metastatic disease. Added to this, there is a
dearth of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. These
facts highlight the urgent need for novel non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are con-
sidered a promising biomarker target for diagnosis of
various malignancies. However, investigation of EVs
typically demands isolation of them from body fluids,
which is difficult and time-consuming process. The
aim of our study was to develop EV-based assay for
the early and non-invasive detection of RCC using a
highly sensitive nanoparticle-aided time-resolved fluor-
escence immunoassay (TRFIA).
Methods: EVs from the serum of renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), bladder cancer (BlCa), benign and healthy sam-
ples were captured with biotinylated anti-tetraspanin-
antibodies (CD63 or CD81) immobilized on streptavi-
din coated microtitration wells. The captured EVs were
detected using 95 nm europium dyed nanoparticles
(polysterene beads packed with ~30,000 Eu3+ chelates)
conjugated with anti-tetraspanin-antibodies (CD63 or
CD81). Isolated EVs-derived from four-cancer cell
lines was taken to validate this TRFIA. Serum samples
from RCC (n = 14), BlCa (n = 14), benign prostate
(n = 14), and healthy (n = 10) controls were analysed.
This study was conducted following the guidelines of
Helsinki Declaration. Participants had given written
informed consent.
Results: This TRFIA can measure purified-EVs with high
sensitivity. The CD63-CD63 assay enabled significant
discrimination of RCC patients from BlCa (4.3-fold,
p = 0.001), benign (fivefold, p = 0.0007) and healthy
(2.8-fold, p = 0.010) controls. Similarly, the CD81-CD81
assay also showed a discrimination of RCC patients from
BlCa (6.3-fold, p = 0.001), benign (3.7-fold, p = 0.020)
and healthy (1.8-fold, p = 0.003) samples.
Summary/Conclusion: The results obtained from this
study suggest that the EVs derived from the serum of
patients with pathological conditions display varying
amounts of tetraspanins. Detection of such varied
expression of tetraspanins using non-invasive techni-
ques may play a major role in the early detection of
RCC. Further validation with large cohort of samples is
required.

Introduction: Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a malignant
cancer that affects the urothelial cells, representing 90%
of all bladder tumours. At diagnosis 75% of bladder
cancers are non-muscle invasive tumours. Importantly,
upon transurethral resection of the bladder tumour,
nearly 35–80% of these patients will experience disease
relapse and 10–20% will progress to muscle invasive
tumour, requiring thereby, a rigorous and expensive
follow-up. Currently, this is performed through the fre-
quent use of highly invasive cystoscopy and the low
sensitivity urine cytology. Thus, innovative liquid
biopsy-based biomarkers that circumvent these draw-
backs are highly desirable for improved UC clinical
management. Here, we AIM to implement a protocol
for the isolation and characterization of extracellular
vesicles (EVs) from UC patients’ urine samples.
Methods: A two-step protocol involving ultracentrifu-
gation (UCt) and by size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) was optimized for urine samples. The isolated
urine-derived EVs from 9 UC patients were then char-
acterized according to their size, concentration (NTA),
morphology (TEM), protein amount (Lowry method),
presence of EV-associated and disease-associated pro-
tein markers (Western blot).
Results: Isolated urinary EVs from UC patients had a
size ranging from 50nm to 400 nm with characteristic
EV morphology, express EV-associated markers as
CD63 and HSP70 and were negative for cell debris
markers. The recovery yield and purity of isolated
EVs following each isolation technique was character-
ized. Upon UCt, SEC was required to deplete most of
the EV-associated THP and albumin protein contami-
nants. Some disease-associated protein markers were
highly enriched in isolated urinary EVs compared to
crude urine.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, these results
indicate that a two-step EV isolation protocol was
properly implemented and validated in UC patients’
urine samples. Notably, several EV-associated disease
biomarkers were detected in the urine of UC patients.
This EV-based liquid biopsy might provide the means
for real-time monitoring of residual disease and relapse
in UC patients.

signature in glioblastoma tumours

Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a
very aggressive type of brain tumour. Different GBM
molecular subtypes (proneural, mesenchymal and clas-
sical) often co-coexist within the same tumour, with
the mesenchymal subtype driving the tumour progres-
sion. Recently, our lab demonstrated that the cargo of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) could mirror the molecular
background of the GBM cells from which they were
derived. Altogether, we believe that GBM cell-derived
EVs can be directly involved in the expansion of the
mesenchymal signature in tumours, thus supporting
GBM aggressiveness.
Methods: Non-mesenchymal (T98 & U138) GBM cells
were “primed” using EVs derived from mesenchymal-
like (U87 & LN18) GBM cells. EV-primed GBM cells
were then co-cultured with their non-primed counter-
parts to determine whether the mesenchymal signature
can “spread” from cell to cell via EVs. Effect on cell
proliferation, migration and invasion (in hyaluronic
acid hydrogels) was assessed following EV treatment
and co-culture. The expression of mesenchymal GBM
markers was measured by western blotting. Further
mass spectrometry analysis of cell and EV content
was
undertaken
to
describe
potential
underlying
mechanisms.
Results: Co-culture with EV-primed GBM cells signif-
icantly increased proliferation and hydrogel invasive-
ness of non-mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, the
stimulating effect of co-culture was even stronger on
the proliferation of EV-primed GBM cells. Moreover,
further proteomic analysis revealed that expression of
mesenchymal
GBM
markers
such
as
CD44
was
increased in non-mesenchymal cells following co-
culture.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that EVs from
mesenchymal GBM cells can be uptaken by GBM cells
from different subtypes, thus stimulating tumour progres-
sion. Overall, we think the present study provides with new
insights for the understanding of GBM recurrence and the
development of potential therapeutic strategies.

Introduction: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is
the most aggressive form of breast cancer. Previously
we reported that the heterogenous population of EVs
released from TNBC cells promotes the growth and
aggression of recipient cells. Here we investigated if,
by using compounds proposed to inhibit EV release i.e.
calpeptin and Y27632 (to block those budding at cell
membrane) and GW4869 and manumycin A (to block
EVs from MVBs), we could reduce the associated
transmission of aggressive phenotype.
Methods: EVs were separated from medium condi-
tioned by TNBC cell line Hs578Ts(i)8, using a discon-
tinuous optiprep density gradient, after the cells were
treatment for 48 hrs with the compounds listed above.
EVs (pooled fractions 3–9 with a density range of 1.03–
1.16 g/mL) were characterised by NTA, BCA, lipid
assay, immunoblot, TEM and flow cytometry. To
investigate the functional effects of the EVs released,
proliferation and migration assays were performed on
Hs578T and MDA-MB-468 cells using the EV to cell
ratios of 1 × 105 EVs/3x103 cells, 1 × 106 EVs/3x103
cells, 1 × 107 EVs/3x103 cells to evaluate dose-
response. EV-TRACK ID EV190109 (Score of 88%).

Results: GW4869 significantly (p = 0.035) decreased
EV release from Hs578 Ts(i)8 cells. Manumycin A and
a combination of calpeptin and Y27632 (Combo)
decreased EV release, but significance was not reached.
Conversely, calpeptin and Y27632 actually increased
EV release; but not significantly. Of the reduced num-
bers of EVs released following GW4869 treatment,
HLA-DR+ EVs were significantly (p = 0.032) enriched.
None of the EVs analysed significantly changed
Hs578 T or MDA-MB-468 growth rates. However,
EVs from cells treated with calpeptin (p = 0.007),
GW4869 (p = 0.025), manumycin A (p = 0.01) and
Combo (p = 0.001) caused significant reduction in
MDA-MB-468 migration compared to the effects of
EVs from untreated cells. Similarly, EV from cells
treated with GW4869 (p = 0.011), and Combo
(p = 0.018) caused significant reduction in Hs578 T
migration.
Summary/Conclusion: While GW4869 was the only
compound that caused a significant decrease in quan-
tities of EV released, the EVs that continued to be
released following treatment with GW4869 or calpeptin
and Y27632 significantly reduced migration of both
recipient cell lines.

Extracellular vesicles from highly metastatic lung cancer cells induce
barrier impairment, permeability, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasti-
city in a 16-day mature bronchial epithelium
Ikjot Singh Sohal, Zulaida Soto-Vargas and Andrea Kasinski
Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA
Introduction: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) tran-
sition plays an integral role in cancer metastasis, which
is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer mortality.
Cancer exosomes induce EMT in bronchial epithelial
cells, however, the epithelial cells inhibit EMT when
allowed to form a mature epithelial barrier with apical-
basal polarity. It is not known if cancer-derived extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) can induce EMT and more
importantly, barrier disruption in a mature epithelium.
Here, we show that EVs from a highly metastatic lung
cancer cell line (Calu6) are) are not only sufficient to
induce EMT in non-tumorigenic bronchail epithelial
cells (BEAS-2B), but are also capable of disrupting a
16-day mature bronchial epithelial barrier by signifi-
cantly reducing TEER, inducing sixfold increase in
permeability and complete loss of E-cadherin at cell-
cell tight junctions.
Methods: BEAS-2B and Calu6 EVs were characterized
using electron microscopy, NanoSight and western
blotting for exosome-specific features. For permeability
studies, BEAS-2B cells were cultured in transwell for
16 days to establish an intact epithelium – confirmed
by measuring TEER (trans-epithelial electrical resis-
tance). Intact BEAS-2B monolayers were treated with
Calu6 EVs at 1, 10 and 20 μg/ml for 24 hrs, and barrier
intactness and permeability were evaluated by measur-
ing TEER, apical-basolateral translocation of dextran
beads and confocal imaging of tight junctions (E-cad-
herin). For EMT experiments, BEAS-2B cells treated
with Calu6 EVs at 1 and 10 μg/ml were evaluated for E-
cadherin and Vimentin levels by qRT-PCR and western
blot after 48 hrs.
Results: BEAS-2B and Calu6 EVs were enriched in 50–
200 nm size range, and CD9 and CD81 were enriched
in the EV fraction in contrast to the cell lysate and vice
versa for GP96. Calu6 EVs significantly impaired 16-
day mature BEAS-2B monolayer’s barrier properties,
which at the highest dose caused 33% reduction in
TEER from 27.0 ± 2.5 to 18.2 ± 3.2 Ω.cm2 (n = 4).
This was further confirmed by ~sixfold increase in
dextran
beads’
apical-basolateral
translocation
in
30 min (14.8 ± 7 ng/ml in control vs 87.3 ± 51 ng/ml
in treated) (n = 3) and complete loss of E-cadherin
expression at cell-cell tight junctions (n = 3). At the
transcript level, Calu6 EVs induced significant down-
regulation of E-cadherin by 36% and upregulation of
Vimentin (mesenchymal marker) twofold (n = 3) in
BEAS-2B cells, indicating transition into mesenchymal
phenotype.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrated the involve-
ment of EVs derived from highly metastatic lung can-
cer cells in inducing EMT in bronchial epithelial cells
and epithelial barrier disruption – the initial stage of
the intravasation process.

family which is involved in cellular stress responses and
associated with worse survival in head and neck cancer
patients, as an essential component of the EV-mediated
radioresistance.
Methods: Small EVs were isolated from conditioned med-
ium from irradiated and non-irradiated BHY HNSCC cells
by combined microfiltration (0.22 µm) and differential
ultracentrifugation. Grp78 surface expression was mea-
sured by proteomic analysis, immunoblotting and bead-
FACS. Radiation resistance of BHY cells was determined
by a clonogenic survival assay.
Results: Increased Grp78 was identified on the surface
of EVs from irradiated cells. The increase in EV Grp78
correlated with increased Grp78 expression at the
donor cell surface. The Grp78 content of recipient
cells also increased upon transfer of EVs from irra-
diated, but not non-irradiated cells, ultimately leading
to enhanced cell survival. To check a potential role of
elevated Grp78 in radiation resistance we overex-
pressed Grp78. Here the modest (3x) overexpression
of Grp78 was sufficient to confer an enhanced radio-
resistant phenotype to the BHY cells. A correlation
between Grp78-dependent increase of radioresistance
and activation of the Akt pathway is yet to be
determined.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results suggest a pivotal
role for EV-transferred Grp78 in modulating the
radiation
response
of
recipient
HNSCC
cells.
Radiation directly increases the cellular and vesicular
Grp78 levels, and subsequent EV-mediated transfer
leads to enhanced Grp78 levels and radioresistance
in recipient cells. This study provides new mechan-
istic insights into the effects of EVs in radiation
response and elucidates an interesting target protein
and
novel
strategies

Introduction: The modelling of cancer progression
should be capable to translate acquired knowledge of
cell behaviour to the real human body conditions.
However, the extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated
from 2D cell models are commonly exploited in
research. Taking into account the specificity of the
prostate cancer (PC) environment, and a strong need
of early diagnosis of castrate-resistance by prostate
cancer (CRPC) patients, we suggest in-depth profiling
of different EV subtypes isolated from 3D culture as a
new tool to model the progressing PC.
Methods: Cells from hormone-resistant prostate car-
cinoma 22-RV1 line were cultured in 2D and 3D
conditions, using 3D CoSeedisTM. ACD plasma con-
trolled for haemolysis and remaining platelets was
taken from patients with PC and CRPC. The 40 frac-
tions of 4 EV subtypes from cell culture and plasma
were obtained by differential centrifugation (DC) fol-
lowed by iodixanol density gradient purification. Each
of
the
fractions
was
measured
by
Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis (NTA), Tunable Resistive Pulse
Sensing (TRPS) followed by ELISA. For that, CD63
and CD9 were used as EV markers, ApoB and ApoA1
for lipoprotein contaminants control, and CD3, CD41
and PSMA as tissue-specific biomarkers for determi-
nation of fractions containing EVs of different origin.
EV-contained
fractions
were
subjected
to
Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS).
Results: In 3D conditions, the 22-RV1 cells produce up
to 1000-times higher EV number than in 2D. Size and
density distribution of EVs derived from 3D cultures
but not of 2D resembled plasma EVs. Size distribution
and biomarker expression among different EV sub-
types allowed distinguishing between PC and CPRC-
derived samples, indicating a potential to translate
these results into clinics for early CPRC detection.
Summary/Conclusion: This work demonstrates a new
approach to study the secretome of a progressing PC
under 3D conditions. The profiles of EV subtypes
produced by cancer cells growing in a 3D spatial archi-
tecture resemble the profiles of plasma EVs and can
serve a useful tool for the establishment of new
biomarkers.

Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most
common primary renal neoplasm, with over 80,000
cases in the US alone each year. Early detection of
RCC leads to consistently better patient outcomes,
and extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from patient
samples may prove to be a valuable clinical tool in the
future. EVs are abundant in blood and urine and show
a large amount of heterogeneity but are difficult to
analyse due to their small size and difficulty in isola-
tion. Here, we employ a multiparametric analysis of EV
surface markers to identify a set of markers that may
prove clinically relevant in future studies.
Methods: RCC cell lines VOK111, VOK130, and
VOK151 were cultured in flasks containing 500 mL of
EV-depleted media (10% FBS, centrifuged 18 hr x
100,000 g). When cells reached ~75% confluency, the
conditioned media was collected and spun at 2,500 g
for 10 mins two times to deplete any remaining debris,
leaving ~ 450 mL of media. This media was concen-
trated to a final volume of ~ 7 mL using a PALL
jumbosep 100 kDa MWCO filter. This concentrate
was purified from protein by using an Izon qEV-10
column, collecting 5 mL fractions. Protein content of
each fraction was analysed using A280 absorbance
while concentration and diameter distribution were
determined through nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA). Pooled samples made of the three most con-
centrated fractions were concentrated to a final volume
of ~190 µL using the PALL Microsep 100 kDa filter
and then used for analysis in the Miltenyi MACSPlex
exosome kit. Flow cytometric data were generated by
the CytoFLEX S and analysed using FlowJo and
MPAPASS software. These positive signals were veri-
fied through bead-only controls and titrations.
Results: The MPAPASS software allowed for heatmap
generation, data reduction, clustering and visualization
of expression patterns. Of the 11 detection antibodies
used across 39 capture beads, CD276, CD26, CD82,
Beta-2 Microglobulin, and CD151 were found to be
prevalent in these RCC EVs. These markers were
found to be co-expressed particularly with CD63,
CD81, and CD29.
Summary/Conclusion: The use of multiplex analysis
allowed for detection of five distinctive surface markers
found to be prevalent in EVs collected from RCC cell
lines. These results demonstrate the utility of multiplex
analysis and MPAPASS software for identifying poten-
tial markers of interest and provide proteins that are
worth exploring further. The next steps to this work
will be developing custom multiplex arrays that tailor
capture and detection of EVs specifically for RCC
pathology.

Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP) carried
by colorectal cancer cells-derived extracellular vesicles as a player in
tumour-educated human fibroblast
Stefano P. Clerici, Sílvio Consonni and Carmen V. Ferreira-Halder
University of Campinas – UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are double-
membrane-bound nanovesicles released by cells play-
ing a key role as mediators of intercellular communica-
tion.
Low
Molecular
Weight
Protein
Tyrosine
Phosphatase (LMWPTP) is upregulated in several can-
cers type, including colorectal cancer (CRC), and it has
been correlated with aggressiveness, chemoresistance
and poor prognostic.
Methods: The aim of this study was to determine
whether CRC cells release LMWPTP-enriched-EVs
and influence tumour microenvironment-associated
cells as a representative tumour education. CRC cells,
HCT116 and HT29, were cultured in serum-free med-
ium for 24 hours. Conditioned medium was concen-
trated by ultrafiltration (MWCO 10 kDa) and EVs were
isolated
by
Total
Exosome
Isolation
Reagent
(Invitrogen). EVs were characterized by nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron micro-
scopy (TEM) and western blotting (WB). LMWPTP
levels were analysed by WB and sandwich-ELISA. To
evaluate tumour education, HFF-1 fibroblasts were
used as recipient cells. The uptake of EVs (PKH26
fluorescently labelled EVs), proliferation (viability)
and migration (wound healing assay) were analysed
in a co-culture model of CRC-derived EVs and HFF-1.

Results: NTA showed a higher concentration of EVs
released by HT29. HCT116 and HT29 EVs displayed a
mean diameter around 140 nm and a cup-shaped mor-
phology. Isolated EVs were positive for EVs-markers
CD81 and TSG101 and negative for GM130 a non-EVs
marker. HT29 lineage as well as derived-EVs are
LMWPTP-enriched in comparison to HCT116 cells and
EVs. Upon incubation, fluorescently HCT116 and HT29
derived EVs were internalized into HFF-1 cells in a peri-
nuclear region. EVs derived from both cells increased the
viability and proliferation of HFF-1 cells. Intriguingly,
EVs derived from HT29 promoted cell migration.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, for the first
time, we showed that LMWPTP can be carried by
EVs derived from CRC cells and LMWPTP-enriched-
EVs can modulate biological aspects of HFF-1 fibro-
blast. Overall, our findings point LMWPTP out as
important player in tumour-educated fibroblast.

Exosomal
miR-181a
Inhibition
by
Vincristine
and
Prednisone
in
Paediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.
Sarah R. Vaiselbuha and Shabirul Haqueb
aStaten Island University Hospital at Northwell Health, Manhasset, USA;
bThe Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, USA
Introduction: Vincristine and prednisone are standard
agents in treatment of paediatric acute lymphocytic leu-
kaemia (P-ALL). Mechanistically, vincristine induces
apoptosis by blocking microtubules formation, while pre-
dnisone binds to cytoplasmic receptors and inhibits DNA
synthesis, both of which lead to apoptosis. The effect of
these agents on exosomal micro-RNA expression and its
functional regulation is not yet investigated. Elevated
levels of miR-181a in circulating exosomes (nanoparti-
cles) has been shown to lead to progression in several
cancers, including ALL. We have previously shown that
leukaemia-derived exosomes induce leukaemia cell pro-
liferation via up-regulating of miR-181a expression and
silencing of exosomal miR-181a reverses this exosome-
induced cell proliferating effect. The objective is to inves-
tigate the effect of vincristine and prednisone on exoso-
mal mi-R181a expression in ALL.
Methods: JM1, SUP-B15, and NALM-6 leukaemic cell
lines were treated in vitro with vincristine (0.1 to
4.0 µM) and prednisone (0.1 to 12.0 µM) in exo-free
medium and apoptosis was measured by MTS assay.
Total RNA of exposed cell lines was isolated and cDNA
was prepared for miR-181a analysis. Expression of
miR-181a was analysed by q-PCR.
Exosomes from conditioned medium of exposed cell
lines were isolated by ultracentrifugation method. Purity
and particle size of exosomes were confirmed by western
blot and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) assay
respectively. Total exosomal RNA was isolated from exo-
somes (Exo-RNA) by Trizol method. Synthesis of cDNA
was carried out with the miScript II RT kit (Qiagen).
Results: Vincristine and prednisone promote apoptosis
in leukaemia cell lines (JM1 and SUP-B15) in a dose-
dependent manner. Both cellular and exosomal miR-
181a expression was down-regulated by vincristine and
prednisone exposure in all three leukaemia cell lines
(JM1, SUP-B15, and NALM-6). These observations
demonstrate that cellular miR-181a down regulation
in the parental cells is stable and can be transferred
to exosomes, confirming the concept that exosomes are
the fingerprint of parent cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that the vin-
cristine and prednisone anti-proliferative effect in P-
ALL maybe induced by another yet unexplored path-
way, that suppresses miR-181a at a cellular and exoso-
mal level in P-ALL, resulting in apoptosis.

Introduction:
Clear

Renal
Cell
Carcinoma
(ccRCC) represents the most common form of kidney
cancer and is among the most lethal of all genitour-
inary cancers. Despite surgery and medication therapy,
most patients with metastatic ccRCC have a poor prog-
nosis. Intratumoural hypoxia is a key factor involved in
renal cancer progression and it is known to promote
secretion of EVs by many types of tumour cells.
Methods: RCC-derived Renca cells, embryonic kidney
derived UB cells, and primary mouse hepatocytes were
used in the study. EVs were purified from cell culture
media by gradient ultracentrifugation, sequential ultra-
centrifugation and Exo-spin™columns. Before EV isola-
tion cells were kept for 24 h either under normoxia or
hypoxia (1% oxygen). EVs were analysed by transmission
electron microscopy with negative staining and immuno-
labeling, by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and

Western blotting. Cells proliferation and viability were
assayed by live cell imaging using IncuCyte ZOOM
(Essen BioScience), cell metabolic activity by Seahorse
XF Analyser (Agilent), RNA expression by qPCR and
ddPCR. Proteins were identified by ultra-performance
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).
RNA libraries were made using NEBNext small RNA

and
sequenced
on
NextSeq550
(Illumina).
Results: We showed that hypoxia induced production
of EVs by RCC cells, and characterized differences in
protein and RNA content of EVs generated by Renca
cells cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.
We also showed that RCC-produced vesicles modify
key features of tumorigenesis (gene expression, meta-
bolic activity, motility, and growth) of target cells.
These data were obtained by using two target cell
types: model mouse kidney cells and primary mouse
hepatocytes, which represent typical site of RCC metas-
tasis with an exceptionally poor prognosis. We pro-
posed that a possible mechanism of EV action in
RCC is related to changes in caveolin-1 function. We
also tracked Renca-derived EVs in a chick embryo
model and in a novel kidney organoid co-culture
assay developed by our group (Xu et al., 2017).
Summary/Conclusion:
Hypoxia
may
influence
tumorigenic properties of RCC by changing rates of
production and composition of EVs.

Introduction: Exosomes are small extracellular vesi-
cles averaging 100–150 nm in diameter. They serve as
a means of intercellular communication. Typically
they consist of structural proteins as well as selected
proteins,
miRNAs,
mRNAs,
and
long
noncoding
RNAs. Thus in an earlier report this laboratory
designed a miRNA targeting a major herpes simplex
virus regulatory protein. As predicted by the nucleo-
tide packaging signal the miRNAs were packed in
exosomes and on exposure to infected cells signifi-
cantly reduced virus yields. HER2 (human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2) plays an important role in
the neoplasia of some breast cancers. The protein is
exhibited on the cell surface and is the target of
therapeutic antibodies.
Methods: Firstly, we report on the construction of a
miRNA targeting the synthesis of HER2 both in cells
constitutively expressing HER2 and in cells trans-
fected with a plasmid encoding HER2. Secondly, we
report that the miRNA targeting the synthesis of
HER2 reduced the viability of HER2 positive cancer
cells both in cell culture and in implanted tumours.
Lastly, we enhanced the anti-tumour activity of the
exosomes by binding to the exosome surface a ligand
with affinity for the HER2 on the surface of tumour
cells.
Results: The 293-miR-HER2 exosomes package with
miRNA designed to block HER2 synthesis and deliver to
cells. These exosomes kill cancer cells dependent on HER2
for survival but have no effect on cells lacking HER2 or
which were engineered to have HER2 but do not depend
on it for survival. The 293-miR-XS-HER2 exosomes carry
in addition a peptide which enables the exosome to adhere
HER2 on the surface of the cancer cells. In consequence,
these exosomes preferentially enter and kill cells exhibiting
HER2 on their surface. The exosomes with 293-miR-XS-
HER2 are significantly more effective in shrinking the size
of HER2-positive tumours implanted in mice than the
293-miR-HER2 exosomes.
Summary/Conclusion: Our studies indicate that exo-
somes carrying miRNA against HER2 have no effect on
HER2 negative cells it was nevertheless desirable to
increase the uptake of exosomes carrying the HER2
miRNAs by HER2-positive tumour cells. To this end
we modified the exosomes to exhibit on their surface a
peptide that bound the exosomes to the HER2 on the
surface of cancer cells. In consequence, we significantly
enhanced the uptake of exosomes carrying the miRNAs
directed against HER2 by HER2 positive cells.

Introduction: CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) have been widely reported to correlate with cancer
patient survival, including ovarian cancer. Even with the
presence of TILs, immunotherapy has limited success in
ovarian cancer. Understanding the interaction between
CD8+ TIL and tumour cells is thus important. Our
hypothesis is that tumour-derived exosomes are released
and taken up by CD8+ TIL such that specific miRNAs
contained within modulate physiological processes that
inhibit CD8 + T cell activation. We aim to identify
miRNAs carried in tumour-derived exosomes that inhibit
CD8 + T cell activation in ovarian cancer.
Methods: We purified exosomes from nine ovarian
cancer cell lines and stocked in high concentration.
Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma expression screening
was performed after 3 days of co-incubation of tumour
derived exosomes, CD8 + T cells, and activators in
conditioned medium. Cell counts and viability were
tested by trypan blue staining at day 0 and day 3.
RNA-seq for exosomes were generated to identify
miRNAs critical in differentiation effects on CD8 + T
cell activations. MicroRNA target matching uncovered
target mRNAs while enriched pathway analysis pre-
dicted potential signalling pathways involved.
Results: Our IFN-gamma screening results indicated
the exosomes exhibit different behaviours in interfering
CD8 + T cell activation owing to different donors.
Exosomes derived from PEO.1 and OVCA432 cells
have
consistent
polarized
results
in
IFN-gamma
expression. Exosomes derived from PEO.1 remained a
low IFN-gamma expression and from OVCA432 stayed
at relatively high level. Small RNAs profiling analysis
between the two cell lines identified 56 miRNAs
(p < 0.05), and 13 miRNAs have been reported with
validated targeting information, and 10 out of 13 have
targets involved in immune signalling. 210 mRNA tar-
gets were uncovered by target matching. CMap search
identified complex connections among mRNAs with
the top 20 enriched pathways actively involved in cell
cycle and immune related behaviours.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
IFN-gamma
screening
identified crucial miRNAs in ovarian cancer exosomes
interfering CD8 + T cell activation. Computational
modelling on both experimental and public multi-
omics datasets predicted promising signalling pathways
of tumour-immune crosstalk for functional validation.

Irradiation of breast cancer cells alters the quality of DNA cargo in the
exosomes that they produce
Sheila Spada, Paul Zumbo, Doron Betel, Tuo Zhang, Nils-Petter Rudqvist
and Sandra Demaria
WEILL CORNELL MEDICINE, New York, USA
Introduction: Irradiation of breast cancer cells with an
immunogenic dose (8GyX3) leads to accumulation of
cytosolic DNA that is sensed by cGAS leading to inter-
feron type I (IFN-I) signalling via cGAS/STING path-
way [1–3]. We previously showed that tumour-derived
exosomes (TEX) secreted by irradiated (8GyX3) (RT-
TEX) but not untreated (UT-TEX) TSA carcinoma
cells carry DNA that stimulates the production of
IFN-I in recipient dendritic cells (DC) via the cGAS/
STING pathway [4]. Moreover, mice vaccination using
RT-TEX,
but
not
UT-TEX,
elicited
anti-tumour
immune response inhibiting tumour growth [4].
Here, we hypothesized that the differential ability of
RT-TEX and UT-TEX to activate IFN-I in recipient
DCs is due to qualitative differences in DNA cargo of
RT-TEX compare to UT-TEX.
Methods: The length of DNA purified from TEX and
from the cytosolic fraction of TSA cells was measured
by Agilent Bioanalyzer. The DNA cargo of TEX was
analysed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and
whole-genome bisulphite sequencing. The percentage
of methylation of total DNA in TSA cells was quanti-
fied by 5-methyl cytosine DNA Elisa kit.
Results: DNA fragments with size between 60 and 250
bp were enriched in RT-TEX compared to UT-TEX, as
well as in the cytosolic fraction of irradiated compared
to mock-treated TSA cells. WGS revealed that the
entire genome was represented in TEX DNA cargo,
regardless of RT. More than 99% of TEX DNA was of
nuclear origin, but mitochondrial DNA was increased
in RT-TEX. Interestingly, we found that RT decreases
the level of methylation in both exosomal and total
DNA in TSA cells compared to the controls.
Summary/Conclusion: These data support the hypoth-
esis that immunogenic RT alters some characteristics of
the exosomal DNA cargo, mirroring molecular changes
occurring in parent irradiated breast cancer cells. The
enrichment in DNA fragments of 60–250 bp in RT-
TEX is intriguing considering that cGAS is optimally
activated by DNA in this length range [5]. We are
currently investigating which features of the cargo
DNA that differ between UT-TEX and RT-TEX may
explain the differential ability to induce IFN-I pathway

DNA signature associated with the ability of TEX to
activate the cGAS/STING pathway could provide a
circulating biomarker of the RT-driven immunogenic

IRE1 inhibition modulates immune phenotype of triple negative breast
cancer cells and cancer-derived extracellular vesicles

in Medical Devices, School of Medicine, National University of Ireland

Introduction: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is
among the most difficult cancer subtypes to treat and
continues to cause a high number of cancer-related
deaths annually. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) transfer
cell type-specific cargo and have important implica-
tions in disease initiation, therapy and outcome. Upon
treatment of cancer cells with low-dose chemotherapy,
released EVs are able to transfer phenotypic traits to
other cancer cells. New treatment strategies for TNBC,
like inhibitors of the ER stress pathway (IRE1) might
impact on EV biogenesis, cargo delivery and response
of cells in the cancer microenvironment. Our aim is
to identify immune modulatory alterations in breast
cancer cells and cancer derived EVs upon treatment
with inhibitors of the ER stress pathway.
Methods: Human TNBC cell lines were treated with
IRE1 inhibitor MKC8866 and cells were analysed for
immune modulatory surface markers, like HLA-I, B7-
H molecules and different integrins. Mitochondrial and
lysosomal activities were investigated by the use of a
Mito- and Lysotracker and analysed by ImageStream
(ISX) technology. Extracellular vesicles were isolated
from cell culture supernatants by sequential centrifuga-
tion, quantified by Nanoparticle tracking (NTA) and
characterized by Exosome bead array. Single EV ana-
lysis of total cell free supernatants and of isolated EVs
was performed by ISX and marker positive EVs were
quantified for absolute fluorescence signals and total
amount by objectives/ml. EV uptake into T cells was
investigated by the use of different EV labelling
strategies.
Results: Several immune relevant surface markers
(HLA-I and CD54) are downmodulated by IRE1
inhibition across different cell lines. Cell surface
expressed CD63 and B7-H3 show cell line specific
downmodulation profiles upon IRE1 inhibitor treat-
ment. Other immunomodulatory marker such as B7-
H1 and B7-H4, integrin CD29, cell adhesion-pro-
moting
CD146
and
stemness/metastasis
marker
(CD44 and SSEA) are unaltered on IRE1 treated
breast cancer cells. Cancer cell derived EVs were
tetraspanin positive (CD9, CD63, CD81), similar in
number
and
showed
differential
expression
of
immune
markers
upon
IRE1
treatment.
Mitochondrial and lysosomal activities were unal-
tered under IRE1 inhibition, whereas cell prolifera-
tion was diminished. No breast cancer-derived EV
uptake of externally labelled EVs into healthy T cells
could be detected.
Summary/Conclusion: Ongoing analyses focus on the
multicolour analysis of multiple markers on single EVs
by imaging flow cytometry and on the functional impact
of cancer derived EVs on T cells delivered by EV receptor
binding.

Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited
disorder characterized by chronic haemolysis and con-
tinuous activation of different cell types. Extracellular
Vesicles (EVs) were described to be at increased levels
in SCD patient’s plasma compared to healthy subjects
and were associated with several clinical manifestations
such as leg ulcers and stroke. SCD patient’s plasma has
increased concentrations of haem, free-Hb and other
proteins and lipoproteins as chronic haemolysis con-
sequence. Here, we report the comparison of three
mostly used isolation protocols to search EV signature
in SCD patient’s plasma by flow cytometry.
Methods: Blood samples were obtained from SCD
patients (n = 3) following Wisgrill et al., (2016) proto-
col. Three different EV isolation protocols were used:
differential centrifugation
(DC),
ultracentrifugation
(UC)
and
size-exclusion
chromatography
(SEC).
Lactadherin and calcein-AM were used to detect phos-
phatidylserine (PS)+ vesicles and membrane integrity,
respectively. Platelet-derived EVs (PEVs), endothelial-
derived EVs (EEVs), leucocyte-derived EVs (LEVs) and
monocyte-derived EVs (MEVs) were quantified. Silica
beads were used to define EVs gate and samples were
acquired in the CytoFLEX cytometer platform.
Results: The quantification of PEVs in UC, DC and

and
MEVs

6,5x105 and 3,7x105 events/mL mean. UC samples
demonstrated a higher concentration of EVs, which
could be more useful to functional studies than DC
and SEC, however, it took more time to separate than
DC. DC was the fastest method to separate EVs from
plasma, being useful to study large patients cohorts, but
showed the smallest overall number of EVs. SEC also
demonstrated high capability to detect EVs in plasma
and the possibility of obtaining a purer sample,
although it is the most expensive and time-consuming
method among all tested. All EVs populations were
detected in the three protocols tested.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, all protocols tested
were efficiently to detect EVs in SCD patient’s plasma
and the definition of the best protocol may vary based on
the research aim and time and budget available.

Extracellular vesicles from patients with sickle cell disease disrupt gap
junctions
Gabrielle Lapping-Carr, Joanna Gemel, Yifan Mao and Eric Beyer
University of Chicago, Chicago, USA
Introduction: Aberrant cell-cell interactions involving
the endothelium are central to the pathophysiology of
sickle cell disease (SCD), including acute chest syn-
drome (ACS), a deadly and unpredictable complica-
tion. We previously demonstrated that the plasma of
SCD patients contains increased circulating small
extracellular vesicles (EVs) compared to controls and
that those vesicles can disrupt endothelial integrity in
vitro by affecting adherens junctions and VE-cadherin.
The current study was designed to examine the effects
of those EVs on other cellular junctions including tight
(zonula occludens 1, ZO-1) and gap junctions (con-
nexin43, Cx43) and to test the hypothesis that the
junctions would be more severely affected by EVs iso-
lated from patients during an episode of ACS than by
ones isolated from the same patient at baseline.
Methods: We identified subjects with SCD in our bio-
bank who had plasma isolated at baseline and at the
beginning of an admission for ACS. EVs were isolated
from platelet free plasma using established methodolo-
gies. To determine the effects on endothelium, cultures
of human microvascular endothelial cells were treated
with EVs for 48 h and studied by immunofluorescence,
immunoblotting and RT-qPCR. Gap junction-mediated

intercellular communication was assessed following
microinjection of Lucifer yellow and neurobiotin.
Results: The distribution and abundance of ZO-1 at the
plasma membrane were minimally affected by SCD EVs.
While baseline EVs did not affect the distribution of
Cx43, EVs isolated during an episode of ACS caused
loss of Cx43 from the plasma membrane. The integrated
intensity of Cx43 membrane staining was decreased by
~20% following treatment with ACS EVs. Cx43 protein
decreased on average by 32%, Cx43 mRNA levels by 21%
and neurobiotin transfer by 67–94% in cells treated with
ACS EVs, compared to baseline EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Circulating EVs in SCD affect
multiple components of endothelial junctions. Gap junc-
tions composed of Cx43 are the most sensitive of the cell-
cell junctions, since their abundance and function are
reduced by ACS EVs even when the endothelial mono-
layer appears intact. Cx43-mediated intercellular com-
munication may be an early and sensitive event in the
endothelial disturbance caused by EVs in SCD patients.

interactions associated with fibrin clot formation in-vitro

Velindre University NHS Trust, Cardiff, UK
Introduction: Platelet concentrates (PCs) have been
utilised for decades to prevent bleeding in thrombocy-
topenic patients and to stop active bleeding. The sto-
rage of PCs however is a logistical challenge due to the
limited 7 day shelf life under standard conditions.
During storage, platelets undergo a number of mechan-
ical and biochemical changes contributing to the short
shelf life of a PC. These changes are collectively known
as the platelet storage lesion. Platelet extracellular
Vesicles (PEVs) are known to increase throughout PC
storage, due to an increase in platelet activation. As
PEVs have previously been shown to be pro-coagulant
and increase in Annexin V binding over PC storage.
The aim was to investigate the effect of PC storage time
on extracellular vesicle interactions on fibrin clot
formation.
Methods: PCs were sampled on alternate days up to
10 days of storage and centrifuged to achieve acellular
plasma. The plasma was subjected to ultracentrifuga-
tion
(100,000xg)
to
pellet
EVs.
The
size
and
concentration of EVs was assessed using Nanoparticle
tracking analysis software, followed by a western blot
to confirm EVs were of platelet origin. The PEVs were
added at a fixed number to a control pooled plasma
sample with added thrombin and tissue plasminogen
activator. The time to clot and 50% lysis time were
recorded by using the turbidometry of the plasma
over time.
Results: EVs isolated from the PC were confirmed to be
of platelet origin by western blot using CD41 as a marker
of platelet origin and CD9 as an EV marker. PEVs caused
a significant increase effect on the fibrin clot formation
(P < 0.001) when compared to the control plasma. PEVs
also had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on the fibrinolysis
time, extending the time taken to lyse the clot. The time
point during storage of PEV isolation had no significance
(P > 0.05) on the fibrin clot.
Summary/Conclusion: PEVs from PCs significantly
enhance fibrin clot formation and extend clot lysis
time, irrespective of PC storage time. Trauma patients
could benefit from a PC unit with high PEV numbers;
however, more research into the potential negative
effects of high PEV numbers, including surplus platelet
activation in oncology patient groups, is required.

Introduction:
Complex
regional
pain
syndrome
(CRPS) is a debilitating chronic disease that occurs
after trauma to the periphery and is intimately asso-
ciated with nerve injury. Its presentation is often
described as an injury that is disproportional to the
inciting event and manifests neuropathic pain, systemic
inflammation, and immune dysregulation. Owing in
part to our poor understanding of disease aetiology,
current treatments for CRPS are insufficient and as a

disease of exclusion there is a lack of quantitative
diagnostic markers. Exosomes are small extracellular
vesicles (sEVs) 30–100 nM in size which provide a
means of cellular communication through their cargo
molecules (protein, miRNA, mRNA, lipids), and have
demonstrated promise in uncovering mechanisms of
disease manifestation and identifying potential diag-
nostic markers. We have shown previously that CRPS
patients have differential expression of several miRNAs
in serum derived sEVs as compared to healthy con-
trols, but little is known on how this compares to the
established mouse tibia fracture model of CRPS.
Methods: Mice undergoing fracture were anesthetized
and subjected to a unilateral tibia fracture followed by
casting of the injured limb. After confirming the estab-
lishment of pain hypersensitivity, serum samples were
collected from fracture model and control mice three
weeks post-injury. sEVs were isolated by differential
centrifugation and characterized using nanoparticle
tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy
and western blotting. RNA-seq analysis is being per-
formed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs.
Results: Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed no sig-
nificant difference in the number or size of sEVs present
in the serum from the fracture model and control mice.
RNA-seq is ongoing and differential miRNA expression
in sEVs from fracture model will be compared to control
samples. Comparative studies identifying miRNAs that
are common between CRPS patients and the rodent
model will facilitate the development of correlational
outcomes between preclinical and human studies.
Summary/Conclusion: Identification of similarities
and differences between CRPS patients and animal
models will aid in directing future studies at clinically
relevant aspects of CRPS aetiology and identifying
potential diagnostic markers for CRPS patients.

Introduction: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an
haematopoietic stem cell disorder with a poor 5-year
survival
rate.
Monitoring
of
Measurable
Residual
Disease (MRD) in AML patients receiving chemothera-
peutic treatment is useful to assess therapy response and
predict relapse. Indeed, many different leukaemia asso-
ciated immunophenotypic protein markers (LAIPs) are
presently useful to detect MRD. Nevertheless, their ana-
lysis currently requires invasive bone marrow aspirates,
thus severely hindering real-time monitoring of the dis-
ease. Therefore, alternative peripheral blood-based meth-
ods are highly desirable for an easy, real-time and cost-
effective monitoring of AML progression.
This work AIMs was to assess the feasibility of a periph-
eral blood EV-based liquid biopsy method for AML disease
monitoring, based on the detection of LAIPs with a known
negative impact on the prognosis of AML.
Methods: The profile of EVs isolated from 12 paired
samples from AML patients’ blood plasma collected at
diagnosis, complete remission (and some at relapse)
was compared and correlated with clinical data. For
that, a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method
was optimized to isolate the circulating EVs from the
blood plasma. The EVs of the 12 paired AML patients’
blood samples were then characterized according to
their size (DLS/NTA), morphology (TEM), protein-
to-lipid ratio (Lowry/Sulpho phosphovanillin assay),
surface
charge
(Zeta-Sizer)
and
protein
cargo
(Western blot).
Results: SEC allowed the isolation of size-resolved plasma-
derived EVs from the peripheral blood of AML patients.
Isolated EVs had a size ranging from 30 nm to 300 nm
with an intact morphology, expressing EV-associated mar-
kers such as HSP70, CD63, CD81 and CD9. Size-resolved
EVs also had a differential expression of Mitofilin, Actinin-
4, Syntenin-1 and Annexin-XI proteins. Several LAIPs
were detected in the isolated EVs and their relative abun-
dance changed throughout the stage of the disease.
Summary/Conclusion: Our preliminary data shows that
AML patients’ circulating EVs carry relevant immunophe-
notypic protein markers, which might predict AML clin-
ical outcome.

RNA input nCounter assay

Introduction: Cell plasticity regulated by the balance
between
the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition
(EMT) and MET is critical in the metastatic cascade.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role
in this balance by shuttling molecular cargos into reci-
pient cells. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of
profiling mRNAs of parental prostate cancer (PCa) cells
with different phenotypes and their daughter EVs using
the NanoString low RNA input nCounter assay.
Methods: PC3-Epi and PC3-EMT cell lines representing
epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype, respectively,
were generated from original PC3 cell line. The cell
culture supernatant was first pre-cleared for any dead
cells and debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 20
min. Without disturbing the pellet, the supernatant was
then transferred to a fresh ultracentrifuge tube and cen-
trifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The remaining
supernatant was then centrifuged to isolate the EVs at
100,000 × g for 120 min at 4°C. The EVs pellet was further
washed in 1× PBS followed by a second centrifugation at
100,000 × g for 120 min at 4°C. The final EVs pellet was
resuspended in 1× PBS for subsequent characterization
(transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking
analysis and Western blot) and nCounter assays. The
total RNA of cells and their daughter EVs were assayed
by the nCounter PanCancer Progression Panel to deter-
mine expression of 770 selected mRNAs. The NanoString
nCounter Low RNA Input Kit with the multiplex 770-
gene primer pool was used for the pre-amplification of
mRNA and overnight hybridization with the PanCancer
Progression panel. Each sample type was submitted to the
assay in biological triplicate.
Results: When comparing all 12 samples, Eisen Cluster
analysis separated all the cells and all EVs into two
groups, regardless of their phenotypes. In subgroup ana-
lysis, the expression patterns between PC3-Epi and PC3-
EMT cells were significantly different. CLEC2B, KDR,
CRIP2, IL13RA2, CC2D1B were significantly upregulated
in PC3-EMT cells, while CXCL8, EPCAM, ESRP1,
TGFB2, CDH1, S100A14, OVOL2 were significantly
downregulated in PC3-EMT cells. The expression pat-
terns between PC3-Epi and PC3-EMT EVs were also
significantly
different.
TBX1,
CAV1,
COL4A1,
SLC35A3, MYC, ITGB2, TIMP4, CAMK2B, PTGDS,
P3H2, ITGB6, VIM, STAT3 were all significantly down-
regulated in PC3-EMT cell derived EVs.
Summary/Conclusion:
The
NanoString
low
RNA
input nCounter assay can provide reliable mRNA
expression profiling of EVs. The mRNA expression
patterns are very different between cells and their
daughter EVs. Both cells and EVs with different phe-
notypes have different gene expressions.

Cancer cell-derived EVs containing alphaV beta6 Integrin regulate
CD163, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells

Hooper and Lucia Languino

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate com-
munication in the tumour microenvironment and play
an important role in cancer progression. Previously, we
have shown the enrichment of alphaV beta6 integrin in
small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated by differential
ultracentrifugation and iodixanol density gradient from
PC3 prostate cancer cells. We have also shown in the past
that alphaV beta6-positive sEVs induce peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) polarization by increasing the
expression of pro-tumorigenic M2 markers, such as
CD163 and CD204. Finally, we have demonstrated that
down-regulation of alphaV beta6 integrin up-regulates
the STAT1-Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) pathway
in cancer cells and in sEVs released by them.
Methods: In order to investigate whether prostate cancer
cell-derived vesicular STAT1 has a causal effect in PBMC
polarization, we down-regulated alphaV beta6 and
STAT1 in prostate cancer cells derived sEVs using
siRNA as well as CRISPR-Cas9 strategies. The sEVs

isolated from these cells were used to analyse M2 polar-
ization by measuring the levels of CD163 in PBMC.
Results: The results show that sEVs lacking alphaV
beta6 inhibit CD163 levels in PBMC in a STAT1-inde-
pendent manner. Analysis of cytokines released by
PBMC upon incubation with sEVs lacking alphaV
beta6, show that PBMC selectively up-regulate the
levels of IL-10 and IL-6, which are predominantly
anti-tumorigenic cytokines. In contrast, sEVs lacking
alphaV beta6 do not upregulate pro-angiogenic cyto-
kines, such as VEGF.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings suggest that
cancer cell-derived sEVs containing alphaV beta6
integrin promote a pro-tumorigenic PBMC phenotype
in the tumour microenvironment by regulating CD163,
IL-6 and IL-10 levels.

Introduction: The recognition of donor-MHC mole-
cules by recipient T cells triggers the immune response
leading to rejection of allografts. Our recent studies
have documented the presence of high numbers of
recipient
APCs
displaying
donor-MHC
molecules
(cross-dressed) on their surface in the lymphoid organs
of mice after skin, heart or pancreatic islet transplanta-
tion. In addition, we have reported that acquisition of
allogeneic MHC molecules by host APCs (MHC cross-
dressing) is mediated by donor-derived extracellular
vesicles (EVs) trafficking through blood and lymphatic
vessels (Marino et al. Science Immunology, 2016). In
the present study, we investigated the ability of allo-
geneic EVs and allo-MHC-cross-dressed cells to initi-
ate a T cell alloresponse in vitro and in vivo.
Methods: EVs were isolated (using differential centri-
fugation)
from
BALB/c
Bone
Marrow
Derived
Dendritic Cells (BMDCs). These EVs were used to
cross-dress B6 splenocytes in vitro. The transfer of
donor MHC class I and II on B6 cells was analysed
by imaging flow cytometry. Next, T cells from B6
mice were cultured in vitro with either allogeneic
BMDC-derived BALB/c EVs or B6 spleen cells cross-
dressed with allogeneic BALB/c MHC. Alternatively,
2 × 109 BALB/c or B6 BM derived EVs or 20 × 106
BALB/c BM cells were injected IV to B6 mice. In both
cases, the T cell response was assessed by activation
markers
detection,
INFg
production
and
cell
proliferation.
Results: APCs cross-dressed with allogeneic MHC
molecules can trigger a pro-inflammatory direct allor-
esponse by T cells in vitro and in vivo. On the other
hand, allogeneic EVs alone were only able to induce
early T cell activation but not proliferation in vitro.
Furthermore, injection of mice with allogeneic EVs
alone could induce some but suboptimal alloresponse
in vivo and only when administered with complete
Freund’s adjuvant.
Summary/Conclusion: Blocking donor EVs release
and subsequent recipient APC cross-dressing may
represent a promising target to selectively inhibit
anti-donor T cell inflammatory responses thus achiev-
ing long-term allograft survival.

Antifungal antibiotic activity of outer membrane vesicles from adherent
Lysobacter enzymogenes C3 against therapeutic and biocontrol targets.
Paul Meers and Kunal Shah
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, USA
Introduction: Lysobacter enzymogenes is a predatory
gram negative bacterial species being studied for bio-
control activity against fungi. Planktonic L. enzymo-
genes C3 produces outer membrane vesicles (OMV)
harbouring
small
molecule
antifungal
antibiotics
(Meers et al. 2018). We show here that the more
biologically
relevant
surface-associated
C3
exerts
remote antifungal activity via OMV as well. The results
have important consequences regarding the natural
mechanism of biocontrol of fungal pathogens by C3
as well as isolation and delivery of therapeutically rele-
vant antifungal compounds.
Methods: OMV were isolated from scraped adherent
C3 culture on agar by similar methods to Meers et al
2018. OMV were stained in some cases with fluoro-
genic SYTO 9 DNA stain for microscopic observation.

Fungal growth was monitored via turbidity readings in
liquid culture or photomicrographs on agar. C3 was
also grown on polycarbonate filter membranes with
defined pore sizes to monitor growth of fungal cells
on the opposite side. Vesicles were also labelled with an
amine-reactive probe Alexa-555 and washed 4x by
sedimentation. Binding of labelled OMV to fungal
cells was observed by epifluorescence microscopy.
Results: SYTO 9-stained vesicles from surface-adher-
ent C3 were similar to previously observed ~130 nm
vesicles (Meers et al., 2018). The isolated vesicles inhib-
ited growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Candida
albicans in liquid cultures at similar potency and were
active against the filamentous species Fusarium sub-
glutinans grown on agar or maize leaves. C3 cultures
grown on filters with 400 nm pore size but not 30 nm
were able to inhibit the hyphal growth of F. subgluti-
nans on the opposite side. Similarly C3 on filters with a
200 nm pore size were able to inhibit growth of C.
albicans.
Observation
of
fluorescently-labelled
C3
OMV after interaction with C. albicans showed binding
specifically to hyphae or pseudohyphae and for F. sub-
glutinans to the growing hyphal tips.
Summary/Conclusion: The OMV of C3 specifically
bind and inhibit the growth of fungal hyphae of var-
ious species without direct C3 cell contact. These data
elucidate mechanisms of biocontrol and suggest strate-
gies for production of therapeutic antifungal antibio-
tics. Meers et al. (2018) Appl. Env. Microbiol. 84(20),

Introduction: Cell derived vesicles (CDVs) are emer-
ging as a novel therapeutic carrier. One of the crucial
factors in the development and therapeutic applications
of CDVs is to understand the precise mechanism by
which vesicles find and enter the target cells. In this
study, we aim to investigate the uptake mechanism of
CDVs produced from natural killer (NK) cells using a
manufacturing process established at MDimune Inc.
Both in vitro uptake assay and in vivo distribution
analysis were performed to provide precise insights
into how CDV exert its effect at the cellular level.
Methods: NK cells were mainly used to produce CDVs.
Breast cancer cells, BT549, and human and rodent
endothelial cells, with a varying degree of ICAM-1
expression, were used to determine the effect of LFA-
1 expressed on the surface of NK-CDVs in cellular
uptake using FACS and confocal imaging analysis.
Next, various inhibitors for uptake pathways, such as
phagocytosis, dynamin dependent endocytosis, and
receptor mediated endocytosis, were used to under-
stand the underlying mechanism of cellular uptake of
CDVs. Biodistribution profile of CDVs were character-
ized using both normal and tumour xenograft models
by IVIS imaging.
Results: Using a recently established manufacturing
process, we demonstrate that NK-CDVs can efficiently
enter the target cells. This study also shows that the
cellular uptake depends on the molecular interaction
between ICAM-1 and LFA-1. In vivo distribution pro-
file of NK-CDVs are also assessed using various
tumour models. Furthermore, we present a cellular
uptake mechanism involved in the entrance of CDVs
into the target cells.
Summary/Conclusion: This study demonstrates that
the CDVs produced at the manufacturing scale can
be easily taken up by cells via specific cellular pathways.
This finding will facilitate the development of more
efficient therapeutics for cancer and other debilitating
diseases.

Introduction: A proper wound healing of the skin
involves
angiogenesis,
extracellular
matrix
(ECM)
remodelling
and
re-epithelialization.
These
three
mechanisms
require
well-organized
interactions
between different cell populations. A key role in this
context is played by myofibroblasts (Wmyo), a cell
population mainly differentiated from dermal fibro-
blasts. These cells contract wound edges and synthesize
new ECM. We previously showed that myofibroblasts
predominantly produces microvesicles (MVs) and can
favour angiogenesis. However, proteomic analysis of
MVs from our previous studies indicated some mole-
cules that can potentially be implicated in ECM remo-
delling.
In
this
study,
we
evaluated
whether
myofibroblasts-derived MVs could affect dermal fibro-
blasts who are highly responsible for ECM regulation.

tion of medium collected from Wmyo cells. Number
and size of MVs were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy and NanoSizer. Multiplex assays
of 45 cytokines were evaluated in MVs samples, Wmyo
and MVs-depleted medium. To examine the interac-
tion of MVs with fibroblasts, we evaluated the uptake
of MVs isolated from Wmyo transduced with a fluor-
escent protein. We then treated fibroblasts cultures
with MVs or a selected cytokine for 5 days and eval-
uated collagen production. Lastly, we neutralized the
selected cytokine in MVs samples before evaluating
collagen production.
Results: PLGF-1 was the cytokine detected in MVs
samples in large amount (0.88 ± 0.63 pg/µg proteins
in MVs). Fibroblasts treated with MVs or PLGF-1
significantly stimulated pro-collagen I level production
with a fold change of 1.80 ± 0.18 and 2.07 ± 0.18.
Moreover, the neutralization of PLGF-1 present in
MVs significantly inhibited the production of pro-col-
lagen I by dermal fibroblasts.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results indicated that MVs
influence fibroblasts pro-collagen production through
PLGF-1 signalling.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a
potent intercellular communication system. While their
functional biological properties are more and more inves-
tigated, the biophysical aspects of their interaction with
recipient cells are often overlooked. Small size (30 to a few
hundred nanometres in diameter) of EVs and their het-
erogeneous origin still pose a great challenge for their
isolation, quantification and biophysical/biochemical
characterization. In particular the complex network of
interactions between differently classified EVs and recipi-
ent cells remains to be further revealed. Here we deeply
investigate the fusion mechanism between EVs and a
model plasma membrane system by an interplay of dif-
ferent structural/morphological techniques to get a mole-
cular description of the interaction helping to clarify the
role of different membrane compartments on the EVs
uptake mechanism.
Methods:
Standardized
protocols
and
Good
Manufacturing Practice conditions were employed to
derive highly stable vesicles of defined size and reprodu-
cible molecular profiles from Umbilical Cord multipotent
Mesenchymal Stem (Stromal) Cells. After a thorough
biophysical and biochemical characterization of EVs
non-contact liquid imaging Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) and, in parallel, Neutron Reflectometry (NR), as
well as Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) experi-
ments were performed on EVs to determine their inter-
action with model plasma membranes in the form both of
supported lipid bilayers and suspended unilamellar vesi-
cles of variably complex composition.
Results: We observed that EVs tend to fuse with the
model membranes with a preferential interaction with
the external layer of the fluid membrane. Moreover we
revealed a stronger interaction with the liquid ordered
domains, strengthening the hypothesis of a critical role
of lipid rafts in fusion mechanisms.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results on the analysis of
the interaction of EVs with artificial lipid membranes
could provide insights on the internalization mechan-
isms of EVs. The approach shown here can be further
extended to convey incremental complexity, adding
glycolipid and membrane proteins to the model lipid
bilayers. This approach combined with data on the
specific biological function of each EV subpopulation
as retrieved by standard functional assays, will turn
useful to select the crucial molecular aspects of EVs
internalization by cells.

Platelet enhanced plasma: a novel extracellular vesicle enriched resuscita-
tion fluid?
Joshua MJ Pricea and Paul Harrisonb
aUniversity of Birmingham, Salisbury, UK;
bUniversity of Birmingham,
Birmingham, UK
Introduction:
Platelet-derived
extracellular
vesicles
(PEV) are the most abundant circulating extracellular
vesicle (EV) and exhibit platelet-like properties, hence
the original term “platelet dust”. Direct phenotyping of
EV surface markers within biofluids is challenging
often requiring time-intensive purification steps that
can significantly alter resultant EV population charac-
teristics. The ExoView™(NanoView Biosciences) speci-
fically captures EV sub-populations and was used to
characterise the EV content of platelet free plasma
(PFP) and a potential novel haemostatic agent designed
for the treatment of severe trauma and haemorrhage,
Platelet Enhanced Plasma (PEP).
Methods: Freeze-thaw cycling of platelet rich plasma/
expired platelet concentrates was followed by centrifuga-
tion to remove platelet remnants and yeilded PEP. PFP
controls were prepared by double centrifugation (2000 g
for 20 minuntes followed by 13,000 g for 2 minutes).
Rotational
Thromboelastometry
(ROTEM)
and
Calibrated Automated Thrombography (CAT) were used
to assess EV driven haemostasis and thrombin generation.
A dilutional and hypothermic model of coagulopathy was
designed to assess PEP. EV capture arrays comprised of
anti-CD41, anti-CD63, anti-CD81 and anti-CD9 were
used (ExoView™, NanoView Biosciences). Captured vesi-
cles underewent interferometric imaging and were quanti-
fied, sized and further probed with fluorescent tetraspanin
markers, Annexin-V and intravesicular markers.
Results: PEP is highly procoagulant, exhibits enhanced
thrombin generation and can restore haemostasis in a
dilutional model of coagulopatic whole blood. PEP can
be generated from expired platelet concentrates, poten-
tially allowing for upscalable production. The predo-
minant vesicle population were PEV with a large
CD41/CD9 population that contained a smaller sub-
population of phosphatidyserine positive procoagulant
vesicles. PFP as expected has a much lower number of
PEV and a CD81 positive EV population.
Summary/Conclusion: PEP is a unique resuscitation
fluid containing high PEV levels for the potential treat-
ment of severe trauma and haemorrhage. Exoview
measurements can be performed in unpurified plasma
and may be useful for measuring circulating EV in
health and disease.

Introduction: During the recent decade, exosomes that
derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-exo) have
been spotlighted as a promising therapeutic target for
various clinical indications, including neurological dis-
orders. We have previously shown that intranasal
administration of MSC-exo, cross the BBB and signifi-
cantly ameliorate autistic-like behavioural phenotype in
BTBR and SHANK3 animal models of autism, repre-
senting a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce symp-

Our
objective is to study the mechanism of action and the
cellular pathways in which the MSC-exo activate their
target, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of pri-
mary neurons isolated from SHANK3 mice treated
with MSC-exo.
Methods: Primary neuronal cell cultures were prepared
from newborn SHANK3 homozygotes mice model of
autism. Cultures were treated with MSC-exo (10^7
particles/ul), isolated from human adipocytes, followed
by RNA sequencing. The alterations in gene expression
between the treated and intact neurons were analysed
for gene ontology
and pathways

compared to proteomics analysis of the MSC-exo in
order to find regulatory proteins that may lead to these
differences.
Results: Bioinformatic analysis revealed several up-reg-
ulators proteins that might be responsible for the
increase in anti-inflammatory and protective factors
seen in the mice neurons treated with MSC-exo. One
of them is BDNF which is known as an essential
growth factor responsible for neuroprotection and neu-
rogenesis. Importantly, no difference in the genetic
expression of cancer-related genes was identified fol-
lowing MSC-exo treatment indicating for their safety.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that adipocyte-
derived MSC-exo carry therapeutic potential in ASD via
alternation
in
gene-expression
related
mainly
to
immuno-modulation, reduce neuroinflammation and
increase neuroprotection and neurogenesis. The benefi-
cial effects of the exosomes treatment in mice models is
being translated into a novel, easy to administer, a ther-

Introduction: Autologous blood-derived products gain
increasing focus in regenerative medicine, especially in
orthopaedics and osteoarthritis therapy. This disease is
characterised by cartilage degradation and inflamma-
tion among other symptoms, which are targeted by
conventional therapies, but genuine cartilage regenera-
tion is rarely achieved. Citrate-anticoagulated platelet
rich plasma (CPRP) is often clinically applied to sti-
mulate soft and hard tissue healing. Recently, cell-free
alternatives to CPRP including hyperacute serum
(hypACT™serum) have been developed. CPRP and
hypACT™serum contain specific profiles of growth
factors, however, they also contain extracellular vesicles
(EVs) that harbour signal molecules including miRNA.
Methods: EVs were enriched by ultracentrifugation
(UC) followed by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) to obtain purified EVs. Particle size and concen-
tration of each fraction was measured by nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA). Fractions with the highest
amount of particles were pooled and concentrated via
UC, before miRNA expression was assessed via screen-
ing with a panel of 372 miRNA-specific primer pairs by
RT-qPCR. Presence of EVs was confirmed by cryo-
electron microscopy.
Results: The EV concentration tended to be lower in
hypACT™serum than in CPRP as determined via NTA.
Similarly, lower diversity of miRNA species was found
in hypACT™serum than CPRP EVs. Around 90% of
detected miRNAs were found in both blood products,
whereas only 30% of miRNAs were shared between
EVs
from
CPRP
and
hypACT™
serum.
While
miRNAs such as miR-101 were consistently depleted
in EVs compared to the corresponding blood product,
others like miR-27a were in enriched in hypACT™EVs,
but not CPRP EVs, indicating release of specific
miRNAs via EVs in response to clotting.
Summary/Conclusion:
Although
the
purification
resulted in high loss of EVs, we identified specific
miRNAs enriched in EVs from CPRP and hypACT™
serum. Their functional spectrum with respect to
osteoarthritis therapy focuses on inhibition of inflam-
mation, inhibition of tissue remodelling via matrix
degrading enzymes as well as preventing senescence.
This renders blood product derived EVs as interesting
candidates for in vitro and in vivo testing with respect
to cartilage regeneration.

Introduction: Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is a
rare, life-threatening liver disease with poor prognosis.
New therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to
treat this disease. Administration of D-galactosamine
(GalN) and a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
triggers acute liver damage in mice, which simulates
many clinical features of FHF in humans and therefore
is widely used to investigate the molecular mechanisms

induced liver injury in animal models. Therefore, the
goal of this study was to identify food-derived exo-
some-like
nanoparticles
(ELNs)
with
anti-NLRP3
inflammasome function to potentially control FHF.
Methods: Seven commonly consumed mushrooms
were used to extract ELNs, which were examined for
anti-NLRP3
inflammasome
activities
in
primary
macrophages.
Results: It was found that these mushrooms contained
ELNs composed of biomolecules including RNAs, pro-
teins, and lipids. Among these mushroom-derived
ELNs, only shiitake mushroom-derived ELNs (S-
ELNs) strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activa-
tion by blocking the inflammasome assembly. This
inhibitory effect was specific for the NLRP3 inflamma-
some because S-ELNs had no impact on activation of
the Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome. S-
ELNs also inhibited the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6
and both protein and mRNA levels of the Il1b gene in
macrophages. Remarkably, pre-treatment of S-ELNs
protected mice from LPS/GalN-induced acute liver
injury.
Summary/Conclusion: Therefore, S-ELNs, identified
as potent inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
represent a new class of agents with the potential to
combat FHF.

Introduction: Recent adverse events resultant from an
exosome product use in a Nebraska clinic, highlight the
importance of assuring product quality and safety stan-
dards. An often-overlooked safety risk is ancillary
reagents remaining within a finished product. When
processes to obtain exosomes utilize cow proteins such
as FBS or bovine sera albumin, failure to adequately
remove these can result in significant adverse allergic
reactions. We evaluated 3 different exosome products
to test the hypothesis that purity of some products may
not be consistent with actual product quality and safety
profiles claimed.
Methods: Three different exosome products (manufac-
turer A, B, and C) were prepared per their instructions
for use. Sample source identity was blinded from assay-
ing scientists. An independent CRO service was used to
conduct the experiments to ensure unbiased assay
execution and data collection. Exosome suspensions
were sampled undiluted for bovine protein content
using commercially available bovine secretome protein
arrays from Ray Biotech. A total of 30 different pro-
teins found in bovine serum were quantified.
Results: Six of 30 proteins were not detected in any
sample. 8 of 24 array antibodies were found to cross
react with human antigens. Of the 16 bovine proteins
that were acceptable for analysis, manufacturers A, B,
and C exosomes contained 15 of 16 proteins,13 of 16
proteins,
and
0
of
16
proteins,
respectively.
Concentrations of individual bovine proteins ranged
from 0.2 to 1,220.1 ng/mL.
Summary/Conclusion: These results indicate manu-
factures A and B are selling potentially dangerous
products. The successful implementation of exosome
products into the clinic requires equivalent demonstra-
tions of safety and quality. This requires adopting strict
quality standards and safety testing during their pro-
duction. Physicians must require safety data prior to
clinical use.

Introduction: Chronic wounds, including diabetic
ulcers and pressure ulcers, are difficult and expensive
to treat. While tissue engineering approaches have lar-
gely failed as a viable treatment for chronic wounds, we
hypothesize that stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles
(EVs) may provide several unique advantages. ZenBio,
Inc has developed a methodology to generate commer-
cial-scale stem cell-derived exosomes using a closed-
system hollow fibre bioreactor capable of continuous
EV production. Additionally, we have shown that by
manipulating
the
cellular
environment,
we
can
improve the pro-healing capacity of the EVs.This tech-
nology leverages the complex healing capabilities of
stem cells without the obstacles of replicating cells.
Methods: We have demonstrated that a mild heat
shock resulted in EVs enriched for stress-response
proteins and increased pro-healing activities in vitro.
We extended this innovative approach to include sti-
mulating adipose stem cells with combinations of heat
shock and growth factors to generate differential extra-
cellular vesicle packaging that enhances pro-healing
activity. To monitor reproducibility across lots and
batches, we rigorously characterized tuned EVs for

particle size and number as well as surface marker and
cargo composition.
Results: Our results using tuned EVs showed efficacy
using cellular models of inflammation, motility, vascu-
larization, collagen production and metalloprotease
activity. We utilized an established murine model of
pressure ulcers to assess the in vivo efficacy of the
tuned EVs. These studies showed a single injection
into the wound site activated a more rapid wound
closure, increased collagen deposition and reduced der-
mal thickness compared to saline control.
Summary/Conclusion: These data strongly support
our hypothesis that EVs may be selectively modified
to improve their wound healing activity by modulating
the culture or tissue microenvironment. Future studies
will use chronic wound models to determine optimal
dosing and routes of administration.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracel-
lular vesicles (MSC-EVs) can reduce inflammation,
promote healing and improve organ function thereby
providing a potential “cell-free” therapy. Prior to clin-
ical translation, there is a critical need to synthesize
existing preclinical evidence supporting their efficacy.
This systematic review provides the most comprehen-
sive evidence map of methods, safety and efficacy for
MSC-EV research to date.
Methods: MEDLINE and Embase were systematically
searched for in vivo interventional studies using MSC-
EVs. Two reviewers extracted data for: 1) methodology,
2) study design, 3) intervention details and 4) efficacy/
adverse events.
Results: After screening 754 articles, 206 studies met
our eligibility criteria. MSC-EVs were used to treat a
variety of diseases including renal (16%), neurological
(12%) and cardiac (10%) conditions. Benefits were
described in 95% of studies across all organ systems
and adverse effects were seen in only three studies; two
showing
tumour
growth.
However,
several
key
methodological concerns were evident. Based on size
criteria for EV subtypes (exosomes/small EVs ~30-
150 nm, microvesicles ~150-1000 nm) only 60% of
studies
used
appropriate
nomenclature.
Ultracentrifugation (70%) and isolation kits (23%)
were the most common isolation methods despite
marked differences in yield and purity. EVs were
inconsistently dosed by protein (68%), particle number
(16%) or cell count (4%), hindering inter-study com-
parisons. Two-thirds of studies used xenogeneic EVs
suggesting immunocompatibility. Techniques to deter-
mine size, protein markers and morphology was highly
heterogeneous, and only 12 and 4 studies met the
characterization
standards
recommended
in
the
MISEV
2014
and
2018
guidelines,
respectively.
Finally, 50% of studies did not incorporate randomiza-
tion which represents a high risk for bias and only a
quarter performed biodistribution studies.
Summary/Conclusion: This systematic review reveals
extensive heterogeneity in methods and intervention
details for animal studies of MSC-EVs. Nonetheless,
nearly all studies showed significant benefits in a wide
range of distinct conditions. The knowledge gaps we
identified
highlight
important
opportunities
for
improving preclinical design and the need for more
standardized approaches in this growing field of EV
therapeutics.

MSC-exosomes as next generation therapeutics for atopic dermatitis
Yong Weon Yi
ExoCoBio Inc, Seoul, Republic of Korea
Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a systemic
inflammatory disease with unknown cause. Recent
approval of a targeted therapy, dupilumab, opens new
era of AD management. However, current therapeutic
options for AD are only targeting inflammation, a
component of AD vicious cycle including itching and
barrier disruption. Human mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) have been highlighted as a novel therapy for
suppressing allergic progress of AD in clinical studies.
Unfortunately, phase III clinical study of human umbi-
lical cord blood MSCs for AD was failed with unknown
reason. Previously, our group reported that exosomes
derived from human adipose tissue-derived MSCs
(ASC-exosomes) alleviated the pathological symptoms
in a murine AD model with concomitant reduction of
inflammation.

Methods: Our group has further investigated the ther-
apeutic effects of human ASC-exosomes in an alterna-
tive murine AD model with skin barrier defects. Large
scale isolation of ASC-exosomes was performed by
tangential flow filtration and isolated ASC-exosomes
were characterized according to the recommendation
by the ISEV. The protein and lipid cargo were also
analysed.
Results:
We
found
that
ASC-exosomes
induced
restoration of skin barrier by inducing de novo lipid
synthesis and reduced the levels of multiple inflamma-
tory cytokines. In addition, ASC-exosomes suppressed
the
expression
of
itching-causing
cytokines.
Transcriptomic analysis of AD skin lesions revealed
that ASC-exosomes reversed the abnormal expression
of genes functioning in skin barrier function, lipid
metabolism, and cell cycle.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, ASC-exosomes
could be a promising cell-free therapeutic option for
the treatment of AD, which affecting inflammation,
skin barrier function, and itching.

Introduction: Cell derived vesicles (CDVs) are nano-
sized vesicles produced by serially extruding cells
through small pores. A growing number of studies
have implicated their therapeutic potentials, with
superior yield compared to other extracellular vesicles
(EVs). However, two key objectives remain to be
accomplished to demonstrate the utility of CDVs in
clinical applications. First, a manufacturing process has
to be developed to allow a large-scale production of
CDVs. Next, these novel vesicles need to be thoroughly
characterized at multiple levels.
Methods: Manufacturing-scale extruders were devel-
oped to allow extrusion of large volume of cell suspen-
sion in a single process. CDVs with approximately
150–200 nm in diameter were obtained by a serial
extrusion. Crude samples were then purified using the
tangential flow filtration method to further remove
cellular impurities. Finally, physical and biochemical
characteristics of purified CDVs were analysed using
DLS, NTA, Cryo-EM, and FACS analysis. Additionally,
CDVs were subject to multi-omics profiling to com-
prehend our understanding in molecular contents of
CDVs. Both mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and nat-
ural killer (NK) cells were used for this study.
Results: In this study, we first demonstrate that the
large-scale extruder efficiently produce CDVs with
consistent quality at the scale that are compatible for
clinical applications. Surface marker and membrane
composition analyses show that the CDVs are primar-
ily formed using plasma membrane of source cells,
with characteristic cellular markers enriched on the
surface. Comprehensive profiling of molecular compo-
nents reveals the unique properties of CDVs as well as
the underlying mechanism of formation of CDVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Recently, we have established a
manufacturing process to enable clinical applications of
CDVs. This study also highlights key molecular fea-
tures of CDVs that can be harnessed to offer a powerful
tool for regenerative and anticancer medicine.

Introduction: Fibrosis is a pathological condition
resulting from abnormal healing of various tissues. It
is triggered by activation of fibroblasts and their sub-
sequent transition to myofibroblast. In consequence,
excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins
leads to impaired organ function. To revert this pro-
cess, we employed extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived
from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).
As a model system, we used human cardiac fibroblasts
(hCFs), since heart fibrosis constitutes a serious socio-
economic problem worldwide.
Methods: We isolated EVs from conditioned media
from three hiPSC lines using ultrafiltration combined
with size exclusion chromatography methods. Next, we
analysed the EVs by NanoSight, transmission electron
microscopy, mass spectrometry and Western blot

methods. Finally, we treated TGF-b-stimulated hCFs
with hiPSC-EVs and evaluated expression of fibrosis-
related genes using real-time qPCR, Western blot and
fluorescence microscopy.
Results:
We
detected
anti-fibrotic
properties
of
hiPSC-EVs exerted on hCFs pre-stimulated with
TGF-b. The EVs significantly decreased the expres-
sion levels of ACTA2, FN, TNC, SNAI2, COL1A1
and reduced the number of myofibroblasts. The
canonical
profibrotic
TGF-b-dependent
SMAD2/3
pathway was significantly attenuated in response to
EV-treatment.
Summary/Conclusion: In this study we demonstrated
strong anti-fibrotic function of hiPSC-EVs. Our find-
ings can further be exploited for future medical appli-
cations to treat fibrotic diseases, such as heart fibrosis.

Introduction: Liver failure is among the most causes of
death in patients with liver disease. Promoting liver
regeneration will help patients with liver failure recover
on their own. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can released
by induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through
paracrine effects and play a pivotal role in inter-cellular
communication in the treatment of disease. In this
study, we investigated whether the iPSCs-EVs have
therapeutic effects on acute liver failure.
Methods: The iPSCs-EVs were isolated by ultracentri-
fugation and identified using nanoparticle tracking
analysis,
transmission
electron
microscopy
and
Western blotting. The isolated iPSCs-EVs were admi-
nistrated D-galactosamine-injured HepRG cells in vitro
and tail intravenously injected into D-galactosamine
and lipopolysaccharide induced acute liver failure
model mice in vivo, respectively. The anti-apoptosis
role and potential mechanism were evaluated using
flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining.
And Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate trans-
aminase (AST) in serum, H&E staining and TUNEL
staining were explored the effect of iPSCs-EVs on liver
injured and liver function. Finally, high throughput
sequencing
of
small
RNAs
was
performed
to
investigate miRNA expression profiles in iPSCs-EVs
and iPSCs.
Results: The iPSCs-EVs that were all 50–200 nm, double-
layered and oval or round cellular vesicles and expressed
the marker proteins CD63, TSG101 and HSP70. In vitro,
the iPSCs-EVs treatment inhibited HepRG apoptosis
induced with D-galactosamine in a time- and dose-
dependent manner and promote the proliferation of
hepatic stem cells. In vivo results showed that iPSCs-
EVs significantly alleviated liver failure, improved liver
function and prolonged the survival period. TUNEL
assay showed that iPSCs-EVs suppress apoptosis of hepa-
tocytes. Moreover, miRNA expression profiles analysis
found that miR17-92a cluster and miR302-367 cluster
were enriched in iPSCs-EVs and iPSCs.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings indicated that
iPSCs-EVs could ameliorate D-galactosamine and lipo-
polysaccharide induced acute liver failure to attenuate
hepatocyte apoptosis, which will be benefit for therapy
of liver disease in the future.

vesicles (BMMSC-EVs), an important component of
MSC secretome, in cartilage repair.
Methods: To test the effect of BMMSC-EVs on OA carti-
lage inflammation the TNF-alpha-stimulated human OA
chondrocytes were treated with BMMSC-EVs and inflam-
matory gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR after
48 h. To access the impact of BMMSC-EVs on cartilage
regeneration the BMMSC-EVs were added to the regen-
eration cultures of OA chondrocytes, which were analysed
after 4 weeks for glycosaminoglycan content by DMMB
and qRT-PCR. Paraffin sections of the regenerated tissue
were stained for proteoglycans (safranin-O) and type II
collagen (immunostaining).
Results: We show that BMMSC-EVs promote cartilage
regeneration in vitro. Treatment of OA chondrocytes
with BMMSC-EVs induces production of proteogly-
cans and type II collagen and promotes proliferation
of these cells. MSC-EVs also inhibit the adverse effects
of inflammatory mediators on cartilage homoeostasis.
Our data show that BMMSC-EVs downregulate TNF-
alpha induced expression of pro-inflammatory COX-2,
pro-inflammatory interleukins and collagenase activity
in OA chondrocytes. The anti-inflammatory effect of
BMMSC-EVs involves the inhibition of NFκB signal-
ling, activation of which is an important component of
OA pathology.
Autophagy, a cellular homoeostatic mechanism for
the removal of dysfunctional cellular organelles and
macromolecules, is essential to maintaining chondro-
cytes survival and differentiation. The expression of
autophagy regulators is reduced in osteoarthritic joints,
which is also accompanied by increased chondrocyte
apoptosis. Our preliminary data indicate that BMMSC-
EVs carry mRNA of natural autophagy inducers and
promote autophagy in OA chondrocytes. Therefore, we
hypothesize that MSC-EVs exert their beneficial effects
on cartilage regeneration by restoring the expression of
autophagy regulators.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, our findings indi-
cate that BMMSC-EVs have ability to promote OA
cartilage repair by reducing the inflammatory response
and stimulation of OA chondrocytes to produce extra-
cellular matrix, the essential processes for restoring and
maintaining cartilage homoeostasis. Thus, MSC-EVs
hold great promise as a novel therapeutic for cartilage
regeneration and osteoarthritis.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) harvested from
supernatants of humane adult bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can suppress
acute inflammatory cues in a variety of different diseases,
including Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) and ischae-
mic stroke. Furthermore, they can promote regeneration
of affected tissues. Following a successful clinical treat-
ment attempt of a steroid refractory GvHD patient, we
intend to optimize MSC-EV production strategies for
further clinical applications. As we observed functional
differences of independent MSC-EV preparations in
vitro, we aimed to adopt an in vivo GvHD model for
the more advanced functional testing of different MSC-
EV preparations.
Methods: To this end we set up a bone marrow trans-
plantation mouse model in which endogenous bone
marrow was myeloablated by ionizing irradiation
(IIR). GvHD was induced by the transplantation of
major
histocompatibility
mismatched
allogeneic
spleen-derived murine T cells. If not treated otherwise,
myeloablated mice developed severe GvHD symptoms.
Results: The GvHD symptoms were effectively suppressed,
when MSC-EV preparations were applied at 3 consecutive
days, which exerted immune modulatory effects in a
mixed-lymphocyte reaction assay. MSC-EV preparations
lacking in vitro immune modulating activities, however,
hardly improved the symptoms of the GvHD mice. Thus,
our results demonstrate that not all MSC-EV preparations
harvested from adult bone marrow-derived MSCs contain
the same therapeutic potential.
Summary/Conclusion: Thus, successful transplanta-
tion of MSC-EVs into the clinics requires a platform
allowing identification of MSC-EV preparations with
sufficient therapeutic, most probably immune modu-
lating activities.

Introduction: Malnutrition impacts approximately 50
million children worldwide and is linked to 45% of global
mortality in children below the age of five. Severe acute
malnutrition (SAM) is associated with intestinal barrier
breakdown and epithelial atrophy. Extracellular vesicles
including exosomes (EVs; 30–150 nm) can travel to dis-
tant target cells through biofluids including milk. Since
milk-derived EVs are known to induce intestinal stem cell
proliferation, this study aimed to examine their potential
efficacy in improving malnutrition-induced atrophy of
intestinal mucosa and barrier dysfunction.
Methods: Mice were fed either a control (18%) or a low
protein (1%) diet for 14 days to induce malnutrition. From
day 10 to 14, they received either bovine milk EVs enriched
using differential ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient
purification or control gavage and were sacrificed on day
15, 4 hours after a Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) dose.
Tissue and blood were collected for histological and epithe-
lial barrier function analyses.
Results: Mice fed low protein diet developed intestinal
villus atrophy and barrier dysfunction. Despite contin-
ued low protein diet feeding, milk EV administration
improved intestinal permeability, intestinal architec-
ture and cellular proliferation.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results suggest that EVs
enriched from milk should be further explored as a
valuable adjuvant therapy to standard clinical manage-
ment of malnourished children with high risk of mor-
bidity and mortality.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs)
are now widely believed as bio-factories releasing
bioactive products responsible for their therapeutic
effect, i.e. cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular
vesicles (EVs). MSCs are highly sensitive to physical
stimuli from their surrounding microenvironment and
can change their characteristics in response to their
environment. The application of 3D spheroids cell
culture allows MSCs to adapt to their cellular niche
environment which, in turn, influences their paracrine
signalling activity. We aim to determine how 2D and
3D culture microenvironments can modulate the EV
production and investigate their anti-fibrotic activity.
Methods: For 2D culture, bone marrow-derived MSCs
were cultured on standard tissue culture plastic. For 3D
culture, MSCs were aggregated into spheroids using
non-adherent 96-well plates and cultured with addition
of 0.25% methylcellulose. To collect conditioned media,
both 2D and 3D MSCs were cultured using serum free
medium for 4 days. EVs were isolated by serial ultra-
centrifugation and were characterised on ExoView plat-
form which allows simultaneous detection of particle
size and expression of CD81/CD63/CD9. Cell lysates
were collected for miRNA isolation and qRT-PCR was
performed to analyse expression of candidate miRNAs.
To model the progress of lung fibrosis, human lung
fibroblasts (HLFs) were cultured with TGF-β1 to induce
fibroblast activation, subsequently exposed to 2D and
3D EVs, and collagen production was measured.
Further, 2D and 3D MSC-EVs were added into human
lung MSCs isolated from healthy and IPF patients and
cell proliferation was assessed using MTS assay.
Results: 2D and 3D MSC-EVs have similar EV char-
acteristics in terms of particle size and EV tetraspanin
markers expression. ExoView analysis showed expres-
sions of CD81/CD63/CD9 and average particle dia-
meters of <100 nm. On a cellular level, we identified
a panel of anti/pro-fibrotic miRNAs which are differ-
entially expressed in 2D and 3D MSCs. 2D and 3D
MSC-EVs have similar anti-fibrotic activity shown by
their ability to reduce collagen deposition in HLF cul-
tures. Both 2D and 3D MSC-EVs could promote cell
proliferation on IPF lung MSCs but no overall effect on
healthy lung MSCs.
Summary/Conclusion: This concept of engineering the
cellular microenvironment to promote EV production

we can culture MSCs for longer timeframe and there-

Introduction:
Photobacterium
damselae
piscicida
(Phdp) is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes a
septicaemia in > 20 fish species worldwide. It repre-
sents a major drawback for aquaculture, whose
importance has been sharply growing as a food sup-
plier. Given the Phdp massive mortality and wide-
spread antibiotic resistance, an effective vaccine is
highly needed. Extracellular products (ECPs) have
an
essential
role
in
Phdp
virulence,
containing
important antigens. However, the ECPs’ identity
remain undisclosed. In our efforts to dissect their
composition,
we
found
that
they
contain
high
amounts
of
outer
membrane
vesicles
(OMVs).
These particles are potent weapons for bacteria and
are being explored in the field of vaccinology, since
OMVs present antigens in native conformations and
are strongly immunogenic, without requiring adju-
vants. This potential associated to the urgent need
for an anti-Phdp vaccine prompted us to isolate and
characterize the OMVs shed by Phdp.
Methods: In order to harvest high amounts of pure
Phdp OMVs, a reproducible optimized protocol was
developed: the bacteria-free supernatant from a Phdp
overnight culture is concentrated, dialysed and ultra-
centrifuged to collect the OMVs.
Results: Analysis of the obtained OMVs preparations by
Transmission Electronic Microscopy and Dynamic Light
Scattering indicate that the main population of vesicles has
sizes around 30–50 nm. Proteomic analysis of the vesicles
revealed the presence of the apoptogenic AB toxin AIP56
that is known to play a major role in Phdp virulence, a
putative pore-forming toxin, a putative adhesin/invasin
and several Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs), including
a 64kDa OMP, predicted to be involved in iron acquisition,
and 5 other OMPs (18–34kDa), with an OmpA-like struc-
ture that may act as adhesins. Moreover, preliminary in
vivo studies suggest that some of those proteins may have
important roles for virulence, since injection of knock-out
strains in sea bass induced a decreased mortality compar-
ing to the wt strains.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
findings
suggest
that
OMVs are a promising vaccine candidate and we are
currently studying their biological activities and deter-
mining
the
antigenic
potential
of
the
identified
proteins.

Introduction: Whole body exposure to high doses of
ionizing radiation (IR) can potentially be lethal if radia-
tion injury is not diagnosed and treated expeditiously.
When considering a non-invasive approach for the
identification of biomarkers of IR exposure, we and
others have studied molecules in plasma, serum, saliva,
and urine. However, these matrices can potentially
have significant background noise, obscuring potential
biomarkers of biological importance. Extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) are fast becoming a platform for biomarker
discovery in radiation research as well as in other
pathologies. However, no groups have investigated the
use of metabolomics to analyse EVs derived from urine
in the context of IR exposure. Furthermore, the domi-
nant protocols for EV isolation from urine require a
large (up to 30 mL) amount of starting volume, which
may not be available for many studies. The aim of this
study was to optimize EV isolation from rat urine and
assess radiation-induced alterations in urine EV num-
ber and metabolic content.
Methods: As a proof of concept, we compared and
optimized several EV isolation methods on small
volumes of urine from male WAG/RijCmcr rats
exposed to 0 Gy or 13 Gy X-rays to the whole body
except the hind leg. Starting with either 500 µL or
1000 µL of urine, we isolated EVs using ultracentrifu-
gation (UC) with filtration, size exclusion chromato-
graphy (SEC), and a proprietary bead-based isolation
method developed by a 3rd party provider. EV samples
were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis.
Metabolomics
profiles
were
measured
using
LC-
QToF-MS.
Results: We found that SEC resulted in the highest
yield of EVs from as little as 500 µL of urine, while
UC was the poorest performing. LC-QToF-MS analysis
revealed that SEC and UC had the most consistent
identification of features, whereas the bead-based
method contained artefacts likely as a result of the
extraction method. We next used SEC to isolate EVs
from a larger cohort of rats exposed to IR and analysed
with MS. EV metabolic content will eb related to dif-
ferences in survival and organ function between sham
and irradiated groups.
Summary/Conclusion: We conclude that SEC is the
preferred method for isolating EVs from small volumes
of urine for broad-based mass spectrometric analysis,
and that the EV metabolome may be a sensitive and
specific early indicator of radiation injury.

oesophageal cancer cells with different differentiation
profiles and different sources of metastasis. Exosomes
from 20 µl plasma of cancer patients at different clinical
stages or with/without relapse and healthy controls were
also prepared by LEAPS. Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-
TOF MS) was employed to directly analyse exosomes.
Protein identities of exosomal fingerprint peaks were
tentatively assigned by correlation with top-down and
bottom-up proteomics.
Results: Start from 20 ml culture medium or 20 µl
plasma,
high-quality
exosomes
rapidly isolated
by
LEAPS are sufficient for MALDI-TOF mass spectrome-
try. It seemed that poorly differentiated cells showed
more exosome release. MALDI-TOF MS fingerprints of
exosomes in cells is cell line specific. MS profiles from
poorly differentiated cells showed more peaks than that
from highly differentiated cells. Fingerprints also allowed
classification of cancer cell lines through software math-
ematical analysis. We identified different numbers of
significantly differentially expressed peaks in exosomes
of various cancer cells. Fingerprints of exosomes derived
from the poorly differentiated cells showed more elevated
peaks. Top four peaks (2,427 m/z, 3,596 m/z, 4,458 m/z,
4,537 m/z) were commonly down-regulated in exosomes
of most cancer cells. Top four protein peaks (2,268 m/z,
5,713 m/z, 6,255 m/z, 6,337 m/z) that might be correlated
to the differentiation profile of cancer cells were also
identified. MALDI-TOF MS detection of exosomes in
the plasma and clarifying identities of potential biomar-
ker peaks will be done in the future.
Summary/Conclusion: The combination of LEAPS
and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry provides a fast
and high-throughput tool for exosomal marker discov-
ery. Potential biomarker identified in exosomes derived
from oesophageal cancer cells or from plasma of cancer
patients by this tool might be useful in cancer diagnosis
and prognosis.

Introduction: Current evidence indicates that extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs) can release from most of cell types
and affect adjacent or distant cells by circulating in all
bodily fluids. Proteomic analysis of EVs from clinical
samples is complicated by the low abundance of EV
proteins relative to highly abundant circulating pro-
teins. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been
overcome as a method to deplete protein contaminants
and enrich EVs.
Methods: we collected serum of healthy women and
cervical cancer patients with stage I–III and then
counted concentration and size distribution of the
EVs
using
nanoparticle
tracking
analysis
(NTA).
Differential ultracentrifugation combined with SEC
was used to isolate and purify EVs from contaminant
proteins. Isolated EVs were investigated their charac-
teristic based on morphology using transmission elec-
tron microscope (TEM) and on expression of CD63,
CD81, CD9 protein markers using western blot analy-
sis. Fraction no.8–10 of isolated EVs in among sample
groups were profiled by nano-liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis.
Results: NTA shows that the concentration of EVs is
increased in patients compared with healthy women.
Proteome profiles of EVs isolated by SEC were com-
pared in each fraction. Moreover, we detected molecu-
lar evidence for fraction-specific molecular pathways in
connection with cancer progression and complied a set
of protein signatures that closely reflect the associated
clinical pathophysiology.
Summary/Conclusion: These unique features in each
fraction among sample groups would be the informa-
tive considering in order to select for further analysis as
in vitro.

Introduction: Recently, diagnostic biomarkers from
exosomes by proteomic analysis have been reported,
but it is required to optimize the isolation protocol to
screen out more effective biomarkers. For serum-origi-
nated exosomes, it has been also reported to isolate
them selectively, however, it is observed that a different
method resulted in different protein profiles in 2-D gel
electrophoresis.
Methods: We isolated exosomes by two discrete meth-
ods, using ultracentrifugation and magnetic separation.
Before ultracentrifugation and magnetic separation,
precipitation using polymer materials was perforemd.
The isolation of exosomes by these two methods fol-
lowed by comparison of their size, total vesicle number,
morphology, and protein markers. To identify protein
biomarkers, proteomic analyis using 2-D gel electro-
phoresis was performed.
Results: Both methods induced enrichment of exo-
some-specific proteins, but protein profiles in each
exosome fraction was totally different. The protein
profiles showd that the magnetic seperation following
a polymer-based precipitation step was more efficient
to screen out candidate biomarkers, which showed
nearly 200 protein profiles originated from exosomes.
Summary/Conclusion: In our study, magnetic separation
of exosomes from serum fraction was optimized for 2-D
gel electrophoresis to observe identifiable biomarkers.

An extracellular small RNA-seq data processing pipeline optimized for
high-performance computing
Chenghao Zhu and Angela Zivkovic
Department of Nutrition, UC Davis, Davis, USA
Introduction: A variety of RNA species is found in extra-
cellular biofluids such as blood, bile, and urine, carried by
extracellular particles including extracellular vesicles (EVs)
and lipoproteins (e.g high density lipoproteins (HDLs)).
The extracellular RNA (exRNA) carried by EVs and HDLs
is of great interest for two reasons: 1) the exRNA within
different carriers could be diagnostic of the state of the
tissues from which the particles originate, and 2) exRNA
has been shown to affect gene expression in target cells.
Although the origin and functions of exRNAs remain
largely unknown, there is growing interest in exRNA
research for the development of diagnostics and new ther-
apeutic targets. Small RNA sequencing is widely used to
estimate the abundance of exRNAs in biofluid samples.
Methods: Here we present a data processing pipeline for
extracellular small RNA sequencing. Sequencing data are
pre-processed through quality control, and then aligned
to the endogenous genome to obtain the gene counts for
various RNA biotypes, including microRNA, tRNA,
rRNA, PIWI-interacting RNA, long non-coding RNA
(lncRNA) and protein coding RNA. It also aligns sequen-
cing reads to exogenous databases, including the riboso-
mal RNA sequence database SILVA, and all sequenced
bacteria genomes available on Ensembl, to estimate the
abundance of exogenous genes.
Results: We analysed a publicly available small RNA-seq
dataset of HDL from three Systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) patients and three healthy controls using this pipe-
line. The miRNA hsd-mir-93, lncRNA AL137186.2 and
AC108050.1 were elevated in SLE patients compared to
controls. Exogenous RNA reads mapped to Bacteroidetes
were also elevated in SLE patients.
Summary/Conclusion: Our pipeline is able to process
exRNA sequencing data and estimate the abundance of
major exRNA species, as well as exogenous RNA tax-
onomy. The pipeline is optimized for the job scheduler
SLURM, and can therefore utilize the full computa-
tional power of high-performance computers. The
pipeline is publicly available on github (www.github.

Characterization of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from Peripheral
Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
patients
Maria Emilia Scharrig Fernandez, Waldo Spessott and Claudio Giraudo

Introduction: IBD is a chronic hyperinflammatory
disorder that severely compromises the intestines.
The
aetiology
of
IBD
is
poorly
understood.
However, it has been associated with a dysregula-
tion of the immune system and gut microbiota and
with genetic and environmental factors. Cumulative
evidence indicates that EVs play an essential role in
modulating
immune
responses.
Recent
research
suggests that EVs derived from dendritic cells, sal-
iva and intestinal epithelial cells may be involved in
the progression of IBD inflammation. However, lit-
tle is known about the contribution of immune
cells-derived EVs with this pathology. The goal of
this study is to shed light on the contribution of
PBMC-derived EVs on IBD pathogenesis.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Methods: Here we characterized and compared the
composition of EVs derived from PBMCs of 3 IBD
patients and 1 Healthy control. EVs were isolated by
differential centrifugations from the supernatant of
PBMC activated with CD3-CD28 beads for 6 days in
serum-free media. Size and concentration were ana-
lysed using a Nano Sight 300 instrument, while the
presence of known EVs markers (CD63, CD81,
Hsp70) was analysed by immunoblotting. Whole
EVs proteome was performed by MS/MS and func-
tional-enrichment analysis was done using FunRich
with Uniprot database.
Results: Proteomics analyses identified a total of 1299
proteins in the four groups. Of those, 673 (51.8%) were
present in both the IBD patients and control. This
group of protein was composed of several Ras-related
proteins, eukaryotic initiation factors, granzyme, CD9,
tubulin, and serpins among others. Patients’ EVs
shared 46 proteins in common such as proteasome
subunit beta type-10, T cell receptor beta, and the
amine oxidase containing copper 3. Interestingly, each
patient sample had a unique group of proteins. Among
these are myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, protea-
some subunit alpha type-3, and signalling lymphocytic
activation molecule (SLAMF1).
Summary/Conclusion: These preliminary studies
show that the EV composition from PBMCs of
IBD patients is specific and differs from a healthy
control. This exclusive composition has the poten-
tial to be used as a biomarker for diagnostics and
progression of the disease, and it could also provide
new insights into our understanding of the cellular
pathways involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. The
studies were performed with corresponding IRB
approvals.

Introduction: Exosomes are a subtype of small extracellu-
lar vesicles (EVs) involved in various physiological and
pathological processes with huge potential as biomarker
resourcesorastherapeutictools.Althoughseveral exosome
isolation approaches are available, complementary studies
focusing on optimizing the methods for human blood-
derived exosomes isolation and method-specific compara-
tive exosomal proteomic profiles will be of clinical value.
Methods: Blood-derived EVs were isolated through
precipitation- and column-based methods and charac-
terized by transmission electron microscopy, nanopar-
ticle tracking analysis and western blot analysis. Serum-
derived exosomal proteomes were analysed by mass
spectrometry (MS). The resulting proteomes were
then overlapped with the proteomes obtained from
exosome-related databases, to determine the % of simi-
lar content. In addition, bioinformatic analysis, includ-
ing Gene Ontology (GO) was carried out.
Results: Both methodologies tested isolated particles with
the expected morphology and size range, although the
column-based method isolated a higher number of par-
ticles. About 75% of the exosomal proteins identified
through MS overlapped with the proteomes extracted
from the databases. GO terms were similar for the pro-
teomes isolated from the column- and precipitation-
based methodologies. The top 3 GO terms identified for
Molecular Function were ion binding, peptidase activity
and enzyme regulator activity and for Biological Process
were immune system process, transport and response to
stress. Further, partial least square analysis revealed a
clear segregation of proteomes obtained by the distint
methodologies and complementary statistical analysis
revealed the proteins differently expressed.
Summary/Conclusion: No major differences were
found in the top 3 biological processes and molecular
function based on GO analysis. Nonetheless, the two
approaches result in different EVs yields and signifi-
cant
proteome
differences
were
identified.
Characterization of distinct methods for blood-derived
exosomes isolation can be useful in the context of EVs
potential in disease diagnostics/therapeutics.

Introduction: We and others are developing biomar-
kers for neurodegenerative diseases using neuronal-
enriched EVs immunocaptured from a suspension of
total plasma EVs. Here we assess how the isolation
method for total EVs affects the yield, purity and
enrichment of neuronal EVs.
Methods: For N = 5 subjects, total EVs were isolated by
EV precipitation solution (ExQ), EV precipitation solu-
tion plus bipartite resin columns (ExU) and Size
Exclusion Chromatography (qEV) from 0.5, 0.5 and
2.7 ml plasma, respectively. Then, neuronal-enriched
EVs were immunoprecipitated using anti-L1CAM anti-
body. In total and L1CAM EVs, we measured particle
concentration by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, pro-
tein concentration, and novel multiplex electrochemi-
luminescence immunoassays for tetraspanins CD81,
CD63 and CD9 on intact EVs.
Results: For total EVs, yield followed the order of ExQ
> qEV > ExU, assessed by particle (p < 0.0001) and
protein concentrations (p < 0.001). L1CAM EVs
immunocaptured after ExQ showed 16-fold higher par-
ticle (p < 0.001) and fivefold higher protein (p < 0.01)
concentrations compared to L1CAM EVs after ExU,
and 41-fold higher particle (p < 0.001) and 11-fold
higher protein (p < 0.001) concentration compared to
L1CAM EVs after qEV. L1CAM EVs after EV precipi-
tation (ExQ) showed 48, 35 and 30-fold higher CD81,
CD63, and CD9 concentrations (p < 0.001) compared
to L1CAM EVs after ExU, and 59, 43 and 36-fold
higher
CD81,
CD63,
and
CD9
concentrations
(p < 0.001) compared to L1CAM EVs after qEV.
L1CAM EVs following 3 different methods had equal
purity
assessed
by
ratios
of
particle/protein
concentrations (p = ns), and tetraspanin/particle con-
centrations (p = ns).
Summary/Conclusion: L1CAM EV immunocapture
preceded by ExQ exceeded the yield of immunocapture
preceded by ExU or qEV. Recovered L1CAM EVs
showed equal purity by particle/protein and tetraspa-
nin/particle metrics. Neuronal enrichment results will
be available by the time of ISEV. Immunoprecipitation
following ExQ, often considered impure, purifies final
isolates as effectively as more onerous methods typi-
cally considered purer. Balancing sensitivity, purity and
scalability is essential for implementation of blood bio-
markers in the clinical setting and may be achieved by
combining techniques.

Introduction: Breath-derived exosomes present new
potential for non-invasive diagnosis of lung cancer.
However, breath-derived exosomes have not been well
characterized and methodology for their purification
has not been optimised. In order to exploit their poten-
tial for diagnosis, it is first necessary to develop meth-
ods that reproducibly
provide high quality pure
exosomes from breath. In this study, we optimise
methods for their isolation and characterise them in
comparison to exosomes derived from cell culture
models.
Methods: In order to characterize exosomes from
exhaled breath condensate (EBC) it was first necessary
to optimize methods for isolation of pure, intact, and
high quality exosomes. To this end, isolation methods

were optimised on cell-derived exosomes and then
applied to EBC, yielding high quality exosomes from
size exclusion chromatography (SEC). EBC exosomes
were compared with those from A549 and WI-cells
using DLS, TEM, and Cryo-SEM. An immunoblot-
ting-grid technique was used to validate the presence
of exosome-specific markers CD63 and CD81. Protein
content of exosomes were quantified and compared.
Results: SEC-based isolation was more effective at iso-
lation of pure and intact exosomes than ultracentrifu-
gation, with the highest purity exosomes obtained in
the middle fractions of the exosome-containing eluate.
Exosomes from EBC had a size range (45–100 nm),
protein content (20–40 ug/mL) and molecular markers
typical of cell-derived exosomes.
Summary/Conclusion: Breath-derived exosomes iso-
lated through size exclusion chromatography are suffi-
ciently
pure
for
diagnostic
purposes
and
are
phenotypically
similar
to
exosomes
derived
from
other sources. We foresee their use in non-invasive

Introduction:
Platelet-derived
extracellular
vesicles
(pEVs) represent the next generation of therapeutic
biologics as they enable a more refined and targeted
approach when compared to crude blood derivatives
currently used for treating diseases such as cancer,
thrombocytopenia and chronic wounds. However,
development of an EV-based therapeutic is hindered
by the lack of a scalable, validated and reproducible
purification process.
In this study, pEVs were isolated from activated
platelet concentrates and purified using Exopharm’s
Ligand-based Exosome Affinity Purification (LEAP)
technology
to
produce
a
functionally
active
EV
therapeutic.
Methods: Platelet concentrates (n = 20) were obtained
from the Australian Red Cross Blood Service and were
activated
by
Exopharm’s
proprietary
process.
Activation was verified by measuring CD62p using
flow
cytometry.
The
resulting
platelet
releasate
(500 ml) was subjected to LEAP purification to isolate
pEVs. For characterization, protein concentration was
determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay, microfluidic
resistive pulse sensing (MRPS) was used to perform a
particle count and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) enabled visualization of EV morphology. Key
EV markers were detected using Mass Spectrometry
(MS) and Western Blots.
To confirm biological activity, human dermal fibro-
blasts were subjected to serum starvation for 16 hours
before treatment with pEVs (15 µg/ml). Cell growth
was recorded by the real-time xCelligence system and
differences in proliferation were statistically analysed
using a one-way ANOVA.
Results: MRPS and TEM both revealed isolated pEVs
to be 100–300 nm in size. The final product was posi-
tive for platelet markers (CD41, CD62p) and key EV
markers (Tsg101, Alix, CD63). Treatment with purified
pEVs significantly increased proliferation in serum-
starved fibroblasts over 48 hours.
Summary/Conclusion: Exopharm’s LEAP technology
is a rapid and reproducible purification process which
produces pEVs that adhere to MISEV 2018 guidelines
and are functionally active.

Introduction:
Exosomes
are
Extracellular
vesicles
(EVs) that are derived from endosome membrane.
They are usually 50–150 nm in diameter, actively
secreted in most living cells. Originally, exosomes
were thought to act as cellular garbage disposals.
Recent studies showed that exosomes not only can
serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, but also can be
used as an ideal delivery vehicle for drugs in therapeu-
tics. Exosomes are natural carrier for mRNA, miRNA,
siRNA, protein, DNA and peptide for long distance
intercellular communication. Isolation of exosomes is
challenging due to their small size and heterogeneity.
Traditional differential ultracentrifugation method is
still the gold standard for exosome purification. To
further explore the potentials of exosomes being as
the therapeutic delivery vehicle or diagnostic reagent,

somes with a simpler method to obtain higher purity

ion ultracentrifugation using Optiprep.
Summary/Conclusion: Our method can be used to
purify exosomes from cell culture medium, serum,

Introduction: Edible plants are emerging as a sustain-
able source for extracellular vesicle (EV)-based drug
delivery vehicles. However, current isolation methods
(e.g. grinding or squeezing) may cause destruction of
plants’ biostructures, and in turn leads to unwanted
effects in downstream applications and complicates
the study of nanovesicles – cell. Therefore, we designed
a simple device that allows the extraction of apoplastic
fluid (AF) from succulent fruits, facilitating EV isola-
tion as well as effective downstream applications.
Methods: An inner filter tube was designed to extract
AF with a determined membrane pore size. AF was
collected by low-speed centrifugation method and then
filtered to eliminate the impurities from the cytoplasm
and damaged cells. Minced juice (MJ) was homoge-
nized by a blender and then centrifuged to remove
large fragments. Subsequently, the differential centrifu-
gation method was employed to extract EVs from AF
and
MJ.
Fourier-transform
infrared
spectroscopy
(FTIR), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were per-
formed to discriminate AF, MJ and their EVs.
Results: The “spectroscopic” protein-to-lipid (P/L) ratio
of AF (1.23 ± 0.03) is significantly lower than that in MJ
(1.27 ± 0.01), showing the higher lipid contents in AF,
which may result from the loss of lipids in MJ obtained
from grinding or juicing methods. Similarly, FTIR
showed the difference in P/L ratio between AF and its
EVs (1.23 ± 0.03 and 1.29 ± 0.02, respectively). NTA
showed the sharper peak and smaller vesicle size in the
following order: MJ (173.0 ± 21.3 nm), AF (154 ± 11.0
nm), AF-derived EVs collected at 40,000 × g and
10,000 × g (108.5 ± 2.4 nm and 95.7 ± 3.1 nm, respec-
tively). Furthermore, TEM study indicated that the col-
lected
EVs
exhibited
a
typical
lipid
bilayer
of
extracellular nanovesicles.
Summary/Conclusion:
By
using
a
reusable
filter
device, we successfully isolated AF from succulent
fruits, paving the way to collect plant EVs without an
interference of significant biodestruction or damaged
cells, hence improving the purity of EVs and facilitat-
ing downstream applications. Moreover, this method is
straightforward, reproductive, and can be potentially
used in a large-scale production.

Introduction: Extracellular particles including extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs), lipoproteins, and free proteins
are carriers of extracellular RNA (exRNA), which has
been shown to regulate cellular function. Because these
particles have different physiological origins, they have
different RNA signatures, so the first step to under-
standing the biology of exRNA is to isolate individual
particle fractions with high purity and efficiency.
Current methods for isolating EVs are optimized for

increased yields and purity of EV fractions but typically
require multiple millilitres of starting plasma and do
not capture the other exRNA carrier particle types.
Methods that can capture EVs from low starting
plasma volumes and can also capture other exRNA
carriers simultaneously are needed for analysing sam-
ples from previously conducted large cohort studies,
biorepositories, and in populations where sample
volume is limiting.
Methods: We have developed a method adapted from
lipoprotein isolation that requires only 500 µl of start-
ing plasma, and uses brief ultracentrifugation (UC)
followed
by
fast
protein
liquid
chromatography
(FPLC) to capture 6 classes of purified exRNA carriers
including EVs, LDL, HDL, lipidated albumin, proteins,
and VLDL/chylomicrons. We have validated successful
capture of EVs by Microfluidic Resistive Pulse Sensing
(MRPS, Spectradyne), transmission electron micro-
scopy (TEM), and Single Particle Interferometric
Reflectance Imaging System (SP-IRIS; ExoView) with
optional fluorescence.
Results: We have observed 1.02 × 1010 particles per ml
from a 1 ml FPLC fraction of EVs measured from
25,000 events by MRPS, confirming that EVs are
being captured by this method. There were also
1.26 × 1010 particles/ml and 2.70 × 1010 particles/ml
in the two subsequent 1 ml fractions that are known to
contain lipoprotein particles, though these were mea-
sured from 1,500 events each. By TEM we confirmed
these observations that EVs are eluting before lipopro-
tein particles with some EVs eluting later in fractions
containing lipoproteins.
Summary/Conclusion: These results confirm the effi-
cacy of the method in isolating multiple exRNA carrier
fractions simultaneously from a single 500uL plasma
sample, making it amenable for the analysis of exRNA
in samples from large cohort studies, biorepositories,
and vulnerable populations such as the elderly and
young children.

Optimizing the isolation of placental mesenchymal stromal cell-derived
extracellular vesicles in a 3D bioreactor system
Leora Goldbloom-Helznera and Aijun Wangbaaaaa
aUC Davis, Davis, USA; bUC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, USA
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from
placental mesenchymal stromal cells (PMSCs) have the
potential to provide neuroprotection at sites of injury.
However, a rate limiting step in EV research is the low
yield, high technical time, and high cost of current
isolation procedures. To address this inefficiency, we
cultured PMSCs in a unique bioreactor system to
increase the absolute yield of EVs per mL of media
and per cell. Future studies will determine if this system
can improve PMSC EV yield without altering the
demonstrated neuroprotective properties of PMSC-EVs.
Methods: PMSCs were cultured in the bioreactor for
ten weeks. EV-conditioned media was collected weekly
and EVs were isolated through differential centrifuga-
tion. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) measured
EV size and concentration. Western blots tested for
normal
EV
markers
(CD9,
CD63,
and
CD81,
Calnexin(-))
and
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assays (ELISA) measured levels of characteristic growth
factors
in
conditioned
media
including
vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neu-
rotrophic factor (BDNF), and hepatocyte growth fac-
tor (HGF).
Results: EVs remained consistent until week eight,
after which a decrease in both EV size and concentra-
tion was seen. Western blots revealed normal positive
expressions of CD9, CD63, and CD81 and negative
expressions of calnexin. Levels of VEGF, BNDF, and
HGF were comparable after 10 weeks. Cost analysis
revealed an overall increase in EV yield for shorter
labour time and lower material cost.
Summary/Conclusion: This initial study uses a bior-
eactor system for a unique source of cells and has
brought us closer to optimizing PMSC EV isolation
protocols for increased yield, lower cost and time com-
mitment, and maintained sample purity. Preliminary
data suggests the EV phenotype and cell secretome are
consistent with those present in current culture set-
tings. Future experiments will assess the preserved
neuroprotective properties of the PMSC EVs.

describe the development of a novel precipitation
method for the isolation of EVs from cell culture
media and plasma that is based on polyethylenimine
(PEI), an inexpensive, water-soluble, and biocompati-
ble cationic polymer. PEI is a group of hydrophilic
cationic polymers that are synthesized as either linear
or branched forms of varying molecular masses (1,000
to 750,000 Da) and are widely used in the biomedical
field as a coating and transfection agent.
Methods: Linear and branched PEI of varying molecular
weights (MW) were tested for their ability to precipitate
EVs from either conditioned culture media (CCM) or
human plasma. Isolated EVs were characterized by
Western blotting and nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA). The small RNA profile of EVs isolated using PEI
from human plasma was analysed by NGS and EV-specific
miRNAs were confirmed by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR).
Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to analyse the proteome
ofPEI-capturedEVsfromplasma.HEK293cells producing
GFP+ EVs were used to optimize conditions for release of
EVs from both linear and branched PEI by fluorescent
spectrophotometry and flow cytometry measure-ments.
Results: Linear and branched PEI were both able to
precipitate EVs as determined by Western blotting for
EV protein markers; however, branched PEI with MW
> 10,000 Da and linear PEI with MW > 25,000 Da were
more efficient for EV precipitation than lower MW
forms. Despite its known ability to bind nucleic acids
PEI was unable to capture cell-free DNA from plasma,
although
RNA
and
in
particular
EV-associated
miRNAs such as mir-142-3p were recovered. MS
revealed that PEI enriches extracellular exosome pro-
teins from plasma. EVs captured from CCM by PEI
could be released from the complex using heparin or
high salt conditions.
Summary/Conclusion: PEI has an unexpected pre-
ference for associating with EVs compared to nucleic
acids in complex biological samples and has a
hitherto
unrecognized
application
for
EV
precipitation.

Assessment of various extracellular vesicle isolation methods through
chemical analysis with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy

Randy Carneya
aDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, University of California, Davis,
Davis, USA; bUC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, USA
Introduction: There is ongoing debate about which is
the most appropriate method for isolation of EVs, with
most labs using some combination of differential ultra-
centrifugation (UC), size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC),
and/or
density
gradient
ultracentrifugation
(DG). Here we applied a surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy (SERS) analysis platform to compare che-
mical composition of the isolate from each method
against lipoprotein standards to assess the relative pur-
ity of the EV preps.
Methods: 2–3 mL of plasma was separated from whole
blood collected from head and neck cancer patients.
Each sample was split into 3 batches and EVs were
isolated by either UC, SEC, or DG. Following isolation,
samples were incubated on commercial SERS sub-
strates and Raman spectra were collected. Lipoprotein
standards were purchased and also measured for com-
parison. Using principle component analysis (PCA),
spectra were analysed for chemical variability.
Results: SERS analysis of SEC, UC, and DG isolated
EVs were chemically distinguishable using simple PCA.
The chemical changes could in large part be attributed
to fitting the differences in spectra to lipoprotein stan-
dards. We found that UC isolated populations clus-
tered with the high-density lipoproteins (HDL), SEC
populations with the low-and very low-density lipopro-
teins (LDL, VLDL), and DG populations were more
variable, but mainly clustered together with the high-
density-lipoproteins (HDL).
Summary/Conclusion:
This
set
of
experiments
matches
our
expectation
that
various
lipoprotein
would contaminate EV preps according to their relative
size and density distributions. No single isolation
method could separate pure EV samples. This study
also illustrates the utility of label-free SERS analysis for
rapid chemical characterization of EVs.

a CELLine Bioreactor system.
Methods: Cultures of 6 adherent cell lines were estab-
lished in CELLine AD 1000 bioreactors and propagated
for up to 19 weeks. Media was changed twice weekly
and cells shed into serum-free conditioned medium
were counted and assessed for viability. NanoEVs
were isolated by sequential centrifugation (2000 g –

Chromatography (SEC). NanoEVs were characterised
in their protein (BCA) and particle (Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis) amount, EV markers (Western
blotting)
and
morphology
(Transmission

microscopy, TEM).
Results: The viability of shed cells varied between cell
lines and through time, suggesting a changing dynamic
during reactor establishment and continuous growth
phases, that was specific to each cell line. HDFa,
BT20 and BT474 consistently shed mainly dead cells
(60–100%), as opposed to MCF7 and MDA-MB-231
which predominantly shed live cells. SEC fractionation
of nanoEVs identified a dominate EV-rich peak and
significant quantities of smaller proteins, highlighting
the need for further purification. NanoEV yields from
each 3–4 day culture averaged 2–7 × 1010 particles,
representative of yields obtained from cells grown in 8
to 28 conventional T175 tissue culture flasks. EV mar-
kers and TEM confirmed the protein profiles and mor-
phology of EVs obtained from bioreactors.
Summary/Conclusion: High density bioreactor cul-
tures offer a physiologically relevant, cost and space
efficient approach to produce significant amounts of
EVs,
providing
sufficient
material
for
numerous
experimental uses. In our hands, with careful twice
weekly management, they can be propagated for up
to 19 weeks without significant changes to the EVs.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have potential
applications for clinical theranostics. Ultracentri-fuga-
tion is most commonly adopted to the EVs isolation,
which is recommended as a gold standard method.
However, ultracentrifugation is time-consuming and
expensive equipment requirement, resulting in the co-
isolation of contaminants such as protein aggregates.
Therefore, our aim is to develop a rapid and efficient
platform to isolate heterogonous EVs based on the
insertion of lipid molecules into the EVs membrane to
avoid co-isolation of non-membranous protein particles.
Methods: Herein, a defected nanoscale functional
Metal Organic Framework (MOF) was constructed
as an efficient platform for EVs isolation. Typically,
one single-stranded DNA was designed and modified
with a phosphate group at the 5ʹ-end and cholesterol
at
the
3ʹ-end
to
form
a
capture
DNA
named
Phosphate−DNA−Cholesterol (PDC). The phosphate
group forms a strong covalent bond with the designed
defeated site of Zr (IV) in MOF UiO-66-NH2 and the
cholesterol inserts into the phospholipid bilayer to
capture EVs without non-membranous particles con-
tamination.
The
formed
MOF−Phosphate−DNA
−Cholesterol−EVs
(MOF@PDC@EVs)
system
was
further treated with DNase I for DNA hydrolysis to
give high pure EVs.
Results: A rapid and efficient isolation platform of
EVs based on a defected MOF functionalized with
Phosphate-DNA-Cholesterol (MOF@PDC) has been
constructed successfully. Compared with Ultracentri-
fugation, MOF@PDC platform promises to isolate size
heterogeneous EVs i) without non-membranous par-
ticles contamination, maintaining EVs intact mem-
brane structure, protein components, and biological
functions; ii) with the ability to capture EVs with 78%
isolation efficiency; iii) makes EVs isolation process
simple and fast, which could be finished in 40 minutes
without requirement of the expensive equipment.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, this rapid and
efficient platform is suitable for isolation EVs from
biological fluid for downstream protein analysis. This
work opens a new perspective in MOF-based separa-
tion researches and may shed light on further studies
towards EVs isolation.

Introduction:
Incorporation
of
pharmacologically
active molecules on the surface or the lumen of extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) is an important strategy for
maximizing the therapeutic potential of EVs. Genetic
engineering of producer cells by introducing DNA
through random or site-specific integration are pro-
mising strategies for creating engineered EVs. Long-
term stability with consistent transgene expression in
the EV producer cells and therapeutic potency of
resulting engineered EVs are crucial for biomanufac-
turing. We present a comprehensive study to investi-
gate stability of transgene expression and potency of
two potential therapeutic engineered EVs derived from
stably selected pools transfected by either random inte-
gration (RI) or site-specific integration (SSI).
Methods: Producer cells were engineered to make EVs
displaying interleukin 12 (IL12) or interferon gamma
(IFNg) by RI or nuclease-mediated SSI into AAVS1
locus. Following puromycin (puro) selection, long-
term cellular stability and transgene expression without
selective pressure was investigated. EVs were generated
from stable cell pools at 0, 1, and 2 months post-thaw
and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation.
Purified EVs were biochemically characterized by
NTA, BCA, Western blot, and cholesterol quantitation.
Transgene expression and biological activity of EVs
displaying
IL12
and
IFNg
were
assessed
by
AlphaLISA and in vitro reporter assays.
Results: Transfection by SSI resulted in faster recovery
in puro selection compared to RI. All stable cell pools,
regardless of integration method, resulted in compar-
able cell culture performance, EV yield, and lipid and
protein content at all time points tested. The engi-
neered EVs also demonstrated long-term stability of
IL12 and IFNg transgene expression and in vitro activ-
ity from both integration strategies.
Summary/Conclusion: Both methods for generating
stable cell lines were comparable in terms of cell stabi-
lity, transgene expression, EV titre and potency, with
SSI having the advantage of speed, allowing for more
rapid iteration cycle times. Thus, both methods are
suitable for the precision engineering of therapeutic
EVs. This work demonstrates feasibility to manufacture
therapeutic engineered EVs from stable cells from
either integration strategy for clinical development.

Introduction: Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in
Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to be impor-
tant carriers of biomolecules, including toxins and
other virulence factors, peptidoglycan, and nucleic
acids. It has been shown that OMVs play an important
role in the delivery of these biomolecules to host cells
and bacterial cells. While many thorough studies have
explored OMV delivery to host cells, few studies have
explored the mechanisms of delivery of OMVs to bac-
terial cells. Our goal was to study the delivery of OMVs
to other bacterial cells. Specifically, we were studying
the oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemco-
mitans (A.a.), a Gram-negative organism associated
with localized aggressive periodontitis, to study the
process by which vesicles from this organism commu-
nicate with other bacterial cells. Overall, we want to

understand the roles specific surface components of
OMVs play in the transport of these OMVs to other
bacterial cells.
Methods: We studied OMVs from two strains of A.a.:
JP2, a highly pathogenic strain, and 33384, a natural
commensal strain. AF488-labelled OMVs were incu-
bated with fresh bacterial cultures. Association of the
OMVs with the bacterial cells was quantified using
flow cytometry. To examine the role of surface-asso-
ciated DNA in this process, DNA was digested with
DNase, and the amount of surface-bound DNA was
quantified with the membrane impermeable DNA
stain, TOTO-1.
Results: Using flow cytometry, we observed JP2 OMVs
were delivered to 33,384 cells, and at a lesser amount to
JP2 cells. Alternatively, 33,384 OMVs associated readily
with JP2 cells, more than to 33,384 cells. This suggests
that the delivery of OMVs to bacterial cells may be a
targeted
delivery
mechanism.
Furthermore,
we
hypothesized surface-associated DNA may play a role
in this interaction. We next digested the surface-asso-
ciated DNA on the OMVs with DNase, and observed a
decrease in association between the OMVs and bacter-
ial cells. This supports our hypothesis that DNA on the
surface of the OMVs plays a role in association.
Current experiments are investigating this interaction
in more detail.
Summary/Conclusion: We have demonstrated that
OMVs are selectively delivered to bacterial cells, and
surface-associated DNA plays a role in this process. We
propose to investigate this process to further under-
stand OMVs delivery to bacterial cells.

bSanta Clara University, Santa

Introduction: Engineered nano-scale exosomes have
great potential as new and targeted delivery vehicles
for the treatment of Gaucher’s disease, the most com-
mon lysosomal storage disease. Recently, we have
reported the design, production, and isolation of exo-
somes loaded with lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase
(GBA). People suffering from Gaucher’s disease do
not have functional GBA, which results in toxic
build-up of undegraded substrates within the cell.
Methods: To evaluate the efficacy of this exosome-
based therapy, a human Gaucher’s disease model is
required. Here, we have utilized near-haploid human
cells (Hap1) modified via CRISPR-Cas9 to model
Gaucher’s disease in vitro. These cells contain a
479bp insertion in the 6th exon of the GBA gene,
resulting in non-functional GBA. PCR, enzyme activity
assays, and flow cytometry have been employed to
confirm the diseased genotype and phenotype.
Results: Characterization of GBA-knock out cells
shows a total loss of GBA enzyme activity. Further
characterization demonstrates a normal growth rate
but an increased number of lysosomes, indicating a
diseased phenotype.
Summary/Conclusion: The utilization of a human
GBA-knock out cell line will enable the evaluation of
the efficacy of our engineered exosomes. Disease mod-
els will be an important resource for the evaluation of
new biologic therapeutics, including exosomes.

to drug release at pH 7.2. Cell uptake and viability

strated accumulation and detection of SPIONs by

Introduction: Gene knockdown by RNA interference
(RNAi) is an alternative, non-invasive method for inhi-
biting proliferation or promoting apoptosis in tumour
cells. This technique allows the specific targeting of key
signalling proteins or mutated genes. Most of the avail-
able transfection compounds suffer from rather pro-
found cytotoxicity in vitro. The aim of our study was to
establish a novel targeted small nucleic acid delivery
system to the cells, with good cellular biocompatibility
and applicability for in vivo studies. For this aim, we
used native, cell own vesicles-exosomes. Since exo-
somes are known to transport peptides and different
RNAs between cells and tissues, these unique, small
extracellular vesicles (EV) may also be useful as trans-
port vehicles for therapeutic siRNA.
Methods: As detected by multiple cell surface protein
expression analysis, exosomes carry specific surface
expression markers, allowing the cellular uptake by
the most of tissues. We established an EV purification
protocol from tumour cell culture supernatants and a
strategy for the efficient EV loading with our test
siRNAs or antimiRs. Here we used the combination
of polyethylenimine (PEI)-complexation of the RNAs
with ultrasound treatment for their loading into the
EVs. Our EV-modified, ultrasound-treated nanoparti-
cles were tested in vitro by measuring knockdown
efficacies in luciferase reporter cell lines or by RT-
qPCR gene expression analysis.
Results: More efficient cellular siRNA uptake was
observed upon EV-modification of our PEI/RNA nano-
particles, accompanied by efficient inhibition of gene
expression. Biological efficacies were retained also after
storage for several days at room temperature. The mon-
itoring of the EV-based particles by FACS revealed a
different time resolution of cellular uptake and nucleic
acid release compared to the classically formulated PEI-
nanoparticles. In an in vivo therapy study in tumour
xenograft-bearing mice, high biocompatibility, signifi-
cant biological knock-down and tumour inhibition were
observed after injection of anti-Survivin siRNAs formu-
lated in our ECV-modified PEI nanoparticles.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
data
demonstrate
the
usability of ECV-modified nanoparticles as efficient
delivery system for small RNAs in cancer therapy.

mediating a phenotype switch to a protective phenotype.
In vivo studies suggest that these EVs can ameliorate
established neuroinflammation, thus making them a pro-
mising drug-delivery tool to target CNS in MS. My pro-
ject focuses on understanding the mechanism of action
and the signalling pathway of EVs delivery and to exploit
this knowledge to specifically deliver different potential
therapeutic molecules. For this purpose, we decided to
characterize the EVs through TRPS technology.
Methods: A murine microglia cell line (BV2) was engi-
neered to stably overproduce endogenous IL4. This cell
line was cultured in exosome-depleted RPMI and sti-
mulated with PMA(20 mg/mL) for 30 min. EVs isola-
tion was carried out by collecting supernatant and

it

ing supernatant was filtered (5 µm) and ultracentri-
fuged at 100,000 g for 2h at 4°C. The EVs pellet was
re-suspended in ice-cold PBS.
Results: The EVs analysis with TRPS shows two popula-
tions of EVs, one with a mean diameter of 60–80 nm and
a broad zeta potential ranging from −10 mV to −60 mV,
while the second population has a mean diameter of 120–
140 nm and a zeta potential of −10/-20 mV. This differ-
ence can be consistent with the different pathway forma-
tion of exosomes and microvesicles. We demonstrated in
vivo the strong phenotypic change induced by our EVs to
resting microglia in a dose- and time-dependent effect.
Then, impairing the physiological procedure of the endo-
some acidification, the effect of our EVs on recipient cells
is higher. Thus, suggesting an endocytic pathway for the
internalization of the vesicles. We further demonstrate
with gradient ultracentrifugation the capability of our
formulation to vehicle endogenous IL4 inside the vesicles.
Even if some protein is co-purified in the procedure, we
know that the half-life of this cytokine is too short to elicit
a strong in vivo response. Consequently, we assume that
the anti-inflammatory effect of our EVs in vivo is a result
of the IL4 internalized in our formulation.
Summary/Conclusion: These data help us understand
more in detail the process of internalization and phe-
notype change mediated by these EVs. Our next goals
are to discriminate between different internalization
pathways and further validate the efficacy of our ther-
apy on the EAE mouse model.

Introduction: The lack of an approved targeted therapy
and the early onset of metastasis highlight the need for new
treatments for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
patients. Interleukin-3 acts as an autocrine factor for
tumour-endothelial-cells (TEC), and exerts pro-angiogenic
paracrine action via extracellular vesicles (nEVs). IL-3Rα
blockade on TEC changes TEC-EV (anti-IL-3R-EVs)
microRNA cargo and promotes the regression of estab-
lished tumour vessels. As TEC are the doorway for “drug”
entry into tumours, we have aimed to assess whether IL-3R
blockade on TEC impacts tumour progression via their
unique EV cargo.
Methods: 27 human TNBC samples, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-453 and MCF10 cell lines were evaluated for
the expression of IL-3Rα. nEVs and anti-IL-3R-EVs were
characterized
by
electron-microscopy,
MACSPlex-
Exosome-Kit and western blot. Proliferation, migration,
apoptosis and sphere formation were evaluated. SCID
mice were used for in vivo experiments.
Results: We noticed that, besides TEC and inflamma-
tory cells, tumour cells from 55.5% of the human
TNBC samples expressed IL-3Rα. MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-453, but not MDA10 cells, expressed IL-
3Rα. In vitro, nEVs provide survival and migratory
signals, while anti-IL-3 R-EVs promoted apoptosis as
well as reduced cell viability and migration of human
TNBC cell lines. In vivo anti-IL-3 R-EV treatment
induced
vessel
regression
in
established
tumours
formed of MDA-MB-231 cells and almost abolished
the spread of liver and lung metastasis. Moreover,
decreased β-catenin and TWIST1 were found in
tumours from animals treated with anti-IL-3 R-EVs.
In addition, anti-IL-3 R-EVs reduced lung metastasis
that was generated via the intravenous injection of
MDA-MB-231 cells. nEVs that were depleted of miR-
24-3p (antago-miR-24-3p-EVs) were effective as anti-
IL-3 R-EVs in down-regulating TWIST1 and reducing
lung-vessel density and metastatic lesions in vivo.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, these data provide the
first evidence that IL-3 Rα is highly expressed in TNBC
cells, TEC and inflammatory cells, and that IL-3 Rα
blockade on TEC impacts tumour progression.

Introduction:
High-grade
serous
ovarian
cancer
(HGSOC) is the deadliest gynaecologic cancer. Its
lethality is explained for late diagnosis at advanced
stages and frequent recurrences despite achieving
complete response with standard therapy. Most of
recurrences occurs at abdominal cavity with multiple
metastasis. Therefore, identifying key determinants
of metastatic process remains as priority to find
better therapies. Current evidence assigns a central
role of the exosomes in conditioning the metastatic
niche in epithelial cancers. Recently, we demon-
strated that statins reduce metastasis in HGSOC in
preclinical models. Here, we decided to study the
effects of statins on HGSOC-derived exosomes and
its capability to condition the metastatic niche.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from HeyA8 ovarian
cancer cell line and primary tissue cultures established
from advanced-stage HGSOCs (with signed informed
consent and IRB approval) by differential ultracentri-
fugation and quantified by nanoparticle tracking ana-
lysis (NTA). Enriched-cancer initiating cells (CIC)
spheroids were established from HeyA8 cells by using
stem-selecting conditions. The paracrine effect of exo-
somes on CIC migration/invasion was studied using
either 3D migration or Boyden chamber invasion
assays. Previous to exosome isolation, HeyA8 cells
were treated with simvastatin (5uM, 24 h) or solvent
and proteins involved in exosome biogenesis/uptake
(Alix, Tsg101), its trafficking (Rab7a, Rab27a) and in
conditioning the metastatic niche (EMMPRIN) were
measured by immunoblotting.
Results: Exosomes isolated from HeyA8 cells or
HGSOCs enhance the metastatic potential of HeyA8-
established spheroids in 3D migration or Boyden
chamber invasion assays. Upon simvastatin treatment,
we observed a significant reduction in migration/inva-
sion induced by equivalent number of exosomes in
HeyA8-derived
CICs.
Under
same
treatment,
we
observed a significant decrease in protein levels of
Alix and Tsg101 and an increase in the inactive forms
of Rab7a and Rab27a in HeyA8 cells. We also observed
a decrease in EMMPRIN levels in HeyA8-derived
exosomes.
Summary/Conclusion: Here, we demonstrated a para-
crine effect of HGSOC-derived exosomes that favour
the metastasis process. In addition, we demonstrated
that simvastatin reduces metastasis induced by cancer-
derived exosomes. Such an effect is partially explained
by changes in the expression of proteins involved in
exosome biogenesis/uptake, its endocytic trafficking
and in the content of proteins conditioning the meta-
static niche. Thus, simvastatin arises as potential ther-
apeutic target to improve outcomes in this disease.

traditionally been performed in cells or isolated EVs,
with no temporal or spatial information that could be
critically important for elucidating their roles in carci-
nogenesis. Since the unperturbed distribution and
organization of EVs in the tumour microenvironment
is associated with their cellular function and can poten-
tially serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker,
there is a strong need for visualizing EVs in freshly
isolated tissue specimens. Currently, only fluorescent
labelling methods enable visualization and tracking of
EVs. We used a custom label-free multimodal multi-
photon optical imaging system to detect and character-
ize EVs and classify them using their optical signatures
both in isolated tissues and in situ tumours.
Methods: Label-free multimodal multiphoton imaging
was used to provide simultaneous, co-registered struc-
tural and functional images of EVs in untreated sam-
ples. Heterogeneous populations of EVs could be
identified from their unique optical signatures.
Results: The intrinsic metabolic and structural proper-
ties of EVs enabled reliable visualization and optical
characterization of EVs from cell cultures and in situ
imaging of tumour-bearing rats. Unique optical signa-
tures were then used for identification of cancer-related
EVs in tissues from human breast cancer patients, and
their density was found to be highly correlated with
clinical diagnosis. In the current study, EVs were iso-
lated from urine of tumour-bearing dogs, and urine and
serum from breast cancer patients. Analysis of EV con-
tent showed higher concentration of NAD(P)H in EVs
isolated from cancer subjects, than from healthy sub-
jects, which reflects the reprogramming of cellular meta-
bolism in carcinogenesis.
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest a poten-
tial label-free optical methodology to detect and char-
acterize EVs by their optical signatures, which can be
utilized as possible diagnostic and prognostic biomar-
kers for cancer.

Introduction:
The
intercellular
communication
mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the tumour
microenvironment plays an important role in tumour
progression. Experimental evidence indicates that EVs
derived from highly metastatic cells influence the beha-
viour of less aggressive cancer cells. We have previously
described a novel intracellular pathway where a frac-
tion of endocytosed EV-associated proteins and nucleic
acids is transported into the nucleoplasm of the host
cell via a subpopulation of late endosomes penetrating
into nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). Here, we better
characterize this pathway and report that it is required
for the induction of an aggressive behaviour induced
by EVs released from highly metastatic SW620 colon
cancer cells in isogenic primary cancer cells.
Methods:
Super
resolution-structured
illumination
microscopy and magnetic-based co-immunoisolation
studies were employed to identify the protein compo-
nents of the nuclear pathway and to monitor the entry
of EV-containing late endosomes into the nucleoplas-
mic reticulum. Human SW480 carcinoma cells expres-
sing ER-GFP and Rab7-RFP were exposed to EVs from
SW620 cells and then live imaged.
Results: We have previously reported that the tripartite
protein complex, containing VAP-A, ORP3 and Rab7
orchestrates the localization of EV-carrying late endo-
somes into NR. We now report that silencing of ORP3
or VAP-A, but not its homologue VAP-B, reverses the
pro-metastatic changes induced by EVs isolated from
metastatic cells on their non-metastatic counterpart,
including transition to an ameboid phenotype, cell
rounding and blebbing. Moreover, we found that cer-
tain nuclear pore complex proteins and importin-beta1
are co-immunoisolated with ORP3, VAP-A and Rab7
suggesting the formation of a large protein complex at
the entry of nuclear pores.
Summary/Conclusion: Interfering with the mechan-
isms regulating this novel intracellular pathway may
find therapeutic applications particularly in EV field
and oncology.

Introduction: Breast cancer commonly traffics to
bone, where breast cancer cells (BCCs) can survive
undetected for years before metastatic outgrowth. In
bone, BCCs interact with surrounding stromal cells,
including osteoblasts (OBs), to shape the metastatic
niche. Our lab discovered there are at least two sub-
populations of OBs in the bone-tumour niche, based
on protein marker expression. One group, “educated
osteoblasts” (EOs) have engaged in crosstalk with
BCCs whereas another group, naïve OBs, have not.
We have novel evidence that EOs regulate BCC pro-
liferation. The purpose of this study was to determine
if extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by EOs play a
role in regulating BCC proliferation. We hypothesized
EVs
produced
by
EOs
would
decrease
BCC
proliferation.
Methods: EO-derived small EVs from culture media
were isolated via ultracentrifugation and character-
ized EVs for size, protein marker expression, and
density floatation to validate the purity of EV sam-
ples. The functionality of EO-derived EVs on BCC
proliferation was examined using EdU and check-
point proteins p21 and p27. BCC protection from
chemotherapy
induced
cell
death
was
also
examined.
Results: We found that EVs produced by EOs, but not
naïve OBs, decreased both triple negative and ER-
positive BCC proliferation in a concentration depen-
dent manner. Furthermore, using an EdU assay, we
found that exposure to EO-derived EVs induces BCCs
to undergo cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, the cell cycle
arrest was reversible and BCC proliferation was
restored upon removal of EO-derived EVs. In addi-
tion, exposure to EO-derived EVs leads to increases in
BCC expression of the G1 checkpoint proteins, p21
and p27.
We next wanted to investigate proliferative signal-
ling pathways that may be deregulated in BCCs follow-
ing exposure to EO-derived EVs. We found that EO-
derived EVs reduce BCC levels of ERK1/2.
Because our data indicate EO-derived EVs induce
sustained cell cycle arrest in BCCs, we desired to know
if EO-derived EVs protected BCCs from chemother-
apy-induced cell death. We found that BCCs exposed
to EO-derived EVs and the chemotherapy drug, dox-
orubicin, have decreased cell death compared to BCCs
exposed only to doxorubicin.
Summary/Conclusion: Altogether, our data suggest
EOs play a crucial role in bone-tumour microenviron-
ment by regulating BCC proliferation.

Phosphorylation of Tyrosine 23 in annexin A2 is essential for its associa-
tion with exosomes and for imparting invasive and proliferative capacity
to other cells

Introduction: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
accounts for 15%-20% of all breast cancer cases. The
lack of targeted-based therapies highlights the impor-
tance of studying TNBC. Elevated levels of Annexin A2
(AnxA2), a Ca+2-dependent phospholipid binding
protein, has been correlated with worse overall survival
in TNBC patients. Our previous data implicate that
exosomal AnxA2 is involved in creating a pre-meta-
static niche and facilitating metastasis in TNBC.
Moreover, N-terminal phosphorylation of Tyrosine
(Tyr) 23 in AnxA2 has been implicated in regulating
several AnxA2 activities in cancer progression. Here,
we demonstrated that N-terminal phosphorylation of
AnxA2 at Tyr23 is important for its association with
exosomes which imparts invasive and proliferative phe-
notype to other cells. Hence, dissecting the regulatory
pathway will be critical for verifying the value of
AnxA2 as a therapeutic, diagnostic or prognostic mar-
ker in TNBC.
Methods: pN1-EGFP plasmids expressing the constitu-
tive phosphomimetic (AnxA2-Y23E) and non-phos-
phomimetic mutant (AnxA2-Y23 F) gene expressing
mutation at Tyr23 site were overexpressed in MDA-
MB-231 TNBC cells. Mutant cells were experimentally
validated for AnxA2 specific functions like migration,
invasion and proliferation. Exosomes were isolated
from the mutant phosphomimetic (exo-AnxA2-Y23E-
GFP) and non-phosphomimetic (exo-AnxA2-Y23 F-
GFP) cells and were analysed for exosomal surface
expression of AnxA2 by immunoprecipitation and
flowcytometry.

cence and its implications on signalling pathways were
studied by Western blot.
Results:

A novel method for epithelial-derived extracellular vesicle isolation and
enrichment in patients with advanced prostate cancer
Arpit Rao, Helene Barcelo and Bharat Thyagarajan
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA
Introduction: Evaluation of changes in prostate cancer
biology is difficult due to presence of lymph nodal or
bony metastatic disease in a majority of patients. A
number of liquid biopsy assays have shown clinical
utility in prostate cancer, but are limited by low sensi-
tivity (e.g. circulating tumour cells-based assays) or
inability to perform transcriptome sequencing (cell-
free DNA-based assays). Epithelial-derived extracellu-
lar vesicles (epi-EV)-based assays are uniquely posi-
tioned overcome both these limitations as EVs are
abundantly secreted into the blood and have RNA-
cargo that mirrors the cell of origin. However, a reliable
method to enrich for epi-EVs is currently lacking.
Methods: Plasma was isolated from the peripheral
blood collected from 15 patients with metastatic pros-
tate cancer enrolled in an institutional biobanking
study before initiation of systemic antineoplastic ther-
apy. EVs were isolated from 500 µl of plasma using a
commercially available qEV 35 size exclusion column
(Izon Inc.). Without subjecting the EVs to any physical
stressors such as centrifugation, CD61 magnetic beads
were used to fractionate the EVs into CD61+ (platelet
derived) and CD61- (non-platelet derived) fractions.
Multiparameter flow cytometry was used to evaluate
EVs that expressed CD9 and EpCAM and were nega-
tive for Calnexin. Nanotracking Analysis (NTA) was
used to quantify both total EV and CD61+ and CD61-
fractions in all patient samples.
Results: The average ± standard deviation of total EVs
obtained
from
the
15
patients
was
6.39x10^11
± 4.60x10^11 EVs/ml of plasma (coefficient of variation
[CV]: 72%) while the average and standard deviation of
CD61- EVs was 1.24x10^10 ± 3.37x10^10 (CV: 271%).
The CD61- EV fraction represented a variable amount of
the total EVs in prostate cancer patients ranging from
0.0001% to 32.21%. Multiparameter flow cytometry
showed that over 80% of total EVs were CD9+ and
calnexin-, suggesting an endosomal origin for a vast
majority of the EVs in these plasma samples. However,
the proportion of EVs expressing EpCAM (marker of
epi-EVs) was higher among the CD61- fraction (5% –
30%) as compared to the CD61+ fraction (0.04% – 1%).
Summary/Conclusion: Our novel method was able to
isolate and enrich the epi-EV from the plasma of
advanced prostate cancer patients. Correlation between
clinical characteristics and EV quantity is being evalu-
ated to identify the reason(s) for large variations in
CD61- EV fraction. Future studies are planned to use
our method in improving the sensitivity of EV-based
assays and increase the RNA yield to facilitate tran-
scriptome sequencing.

Introduction: Recurrent/metastatic medulloblastoma
(MB) is a devastating disease with an abysmal prog-
nosis of less than 10% 5-year survival. The secretion of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) has emerged as a pivotal
mediator for communication in the tumour microen-
vironment during metastasis. The most investigated
EV’s are exosomes, nanovesicles secreted by all cell
types
and
able
to
cross
the
blood-brain-barrier.
Matrix
metalloproteinases
(MMPs)
are
enzymes
secreted by tumour cells that can potentiate their dis-
semination by modification of the extracellular matrix.
We hypothesise that exosomal MMP2 and its inducer
EMMPRIN could enhance metastasis of MB.
Methods: Proliferation, invasion and migration assays

primary cell lines pre-treated with metastatic tumour
cell-derived exosomes. Gelatin zymography and wes-
tern blotting were performed to confirm MMP2 func-
tional activity in cell lines and exosomes. Nanoscale
flow cytometry was used to measure surface exosomal
EMMPRIN levels. Exosomal MMP2 and EMMPRIN
were modulated at the RNA level.
Results: Number of exosomes is directly related to the
migratory
behaviour
of
parental
MB
cell
lines
(p < 0.01). Notably, functional exosomal MMP2 and
EMMPRIN levels also correlate with this. Furthermore,
exosomes
from
metastatic
cell
lines
conferred
enhanced migration and invasion on their matched
isogenic primary (non-metastatic) cell line pair by
~3.8-fold (p < 0.01). Exosomes from metastatic cell
lines also conferred increased migration on poorly
migratory foetal neuronal stem cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Together this data suggests that
exosomal MMP2 and EMMPRIN may promote medul-
loblastoma metastasis and supports analysis of exoso-
mal MMP2 and EMMPRIN levels in patient cerebral
spinal fluid samples.

Anti-migratory effect of Nm23-H1 via exosomes
Vasu Saini, Yung Hou Wong and Siu Nam Sun
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong
Introduction: Exosomes secreted from cancer cells
harbour the potential to regulate intracellular signal-
ling and promote metastasis. Wherein, metastasis
suppressor genes (MSGs) play a pivotal role in reg-
ulating such signalling cascades. However, the regu-
lation gets hampered due to low expression of MSGs
under metastatic conditions. Nm23-H1, product of
first identified metastasis suppressor gene NME1, is
significantly downregulated under metastatic condi-
tions. Nm23-H1 serves as a regulator of small
GTPases.
Several
evidences
have
highlighted
an
involvement of small GTPases (such as Rab5, Rab7
and
Rab27)
in
the
biogenesis
of
exosomes.
In
addition,
bacterial
homolog
of
Nm23
has
been
shown to interact with Rab5 and Rab7. However,
experimental
evidence
supporting
a
relationship
between exosomes and Nm23-H1 is lacking. Our
current focus is to deduce the relationship between
exosomes and MSGs.
Methods: Breast cancer cell lines were used to assess
the effect of exosomes isolated from highly metastatic
cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) on lower/non metastatic
cells (MCF-7 cells). NME1 was overexpressed in
MDA-MB-231 cells and subsequently used to isolate
exosome fractions. Equivalent amount of isolated exo-
some fractions from MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-
MB-231/NME1 cells were utilized to access their effect
on migration and difference in exosome markers.
Results: We observed an enrichment of Nm23-H1 in
the exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells upon
overexpression of NME1. Proteinase K protection assay
confirmed the packaging of Nm23-H1 inside the exo-
somes isolated from MDA-MB-231/NME1 cells and
excluded the possibility of membrane association of
Nm23-H1. Additionally, overexpression of Nm23-H1
led to a significant reduction in the ability of MDA-
MB-231 exosomes to stimulate movement of MCF-7
cells as confirmed by wound healing assays. Our data
also highlights a clear reduction in the protein levels of
exosome markers such as CD63, CD9 and Alix in the
exosome fraction isolated from MDA-MB-231/NME1
cells as compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly,
Rab7A, a protein involved in the endosome-lysosome
fusion was also present in lower amount in the exo-
somes isolated from Nm23-H1 overexpressing cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data highlights an anti-
migratory effect of Nm23-H1 via exosomes. These find-
ings support a regulatory role of Nm23-H1 in the packa-
ging or release of exosomes in highly metastatic breast
cancer cells, and further suggest that metastasis suppres-
sor proteins may be involved in the regulation or packa-
ging of exosomes. Additional studies will be required to
decipher the downstream signalling of Nm23-H1 which
affects the biogenesis of exosomes as well as to assess the
effect of Nm23-H1 overexpression on the content of
exosomes. These insights could help us delineate the
complex exosome biogenesis pathway and provide new
potential drug targets for exosome regulation.

Moderate exercise has beneficial effects on mouse ischaemic stroke by
enhancing the functions of circulating endothelial progenitor cell-derived
exosomes via activation of the miR-126/BDNF/PI3 k pathway
Jinju Wang, Shuzhen Chen and Ji Bihl
Wright State University, Dayton, USA
Introduction: Exosomes (EXs) are emerging as novel
players in the beneficial effects induced by exercise on
vascular diseases. Our recent study has revealed that
moderate exercise enhances the function of circulating
endothelial progenitor cell-derived exosomes (cEPC-
EXs) on protecting endothelial cells against hypoxia
injury. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether
exercise-regulated cEPC-EXs contribute to the benefi-
cial effects of exercise on ischaemic stroke (IS).
Methods: C57BL/6 mice performed moderate treadmill
exercise (10 m/min, 4-wks) before IS induced by mid-
dle cerebral artery occlusion surgery. Acute injury was
evaluated at day 2 by determining neurologic deficit,
infarct volume, cell apoptosis in the penumbra and
neurologic recovery was assessed by determining
angiogenesis/neurogenesis, sensorimotor functions at
day 28. The correlations of cEPC-EXs and their carried
miR-126 with neurological parameters were analysed.
The underlying mechanism of the effects of cEPC-EXs
isolated from exercised mice was explored in a hypoxia
neuron model. Cellular miR-126 level, apoptosis, axon
growth ability and gene expressions (cas-3, BDNF and
Akt) were measured.
Results: 1) Exercised mice had a smaller infarct volume
on day 2, which was associated with decreased cell
apoptosis and cleaved cas-3 level, and a higher micro-
vessel density than those in control; 2) The elevated
cEPC-EX level positively correlated with tEPC-EXs in
ischaemic brain of exercised mice on day 2. The upre-
gulated miR-126 level positively correlated with the
numbers of tEPC-EXs in ischaemic brain; 3) The num-
bers of cEPC-EXs and their carried miR-126 level
negatively correlated with the infarct volume, cell
apoptosis and positively correlated with the microves-
sel density in the peri-infarct area on day 2; 4)
Exercised mice had decreased infarct volume, increased
microvessel density, promoted angiogenesis/neurogen-
esis and improved sensorimotor functions on day 28,
accompanying with upregulated levels of BDNF, p-
TrkB/TrkB and p-Akt/Akt; 5) cEPC-EXs of exercised
mice protected neurons against hypoxia-induced apop-
tosis and compromised axon growth ability which were
blocked by miR-126 and PI3 k inhibitors.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data suggest that the pro-
tective effects of moderate exercise intervention on the
brain against MCAO-induced ischaemic injury are
ascribed to cEPC-EXs and their carried miR-126.

Introduction: Alveolar type 2 epithelial cell (AT2)
senescence is implicated in the pathogenesis of lung
fibrosis, a progressive fatal condition. Syndecan-1, a
heparan sulphate proteoglycan, is overexpressed by
AT2 cells of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) and bleomycin-injured WT mice and the over-
expression of syndecan-1 is profibrotic. Moreover,
syndecan-1 deficient (Sdc1-/-) mice had less lung
fibrosis after bleomycin injury. We reported that
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) of bleomycin-injured WT mice augmented
lung fibrosis whereas the Sdc1-/- -BAL-EVs attenu-
ated the process. Moreover, WT-BAL-EVs expressed
lower level of anti-fibrotic miRNAs (miR-34b-5p,
−142-3p, −144-3p, and −503-5p) compared to the
Sdc1-/–BAL-EVs. These miRNAs targeted genes in
the cellular senescence pathway indicating that synde-
can-1 altered microRNA profiles in the BAL-EVs to
promote cellular senescence during lung fibrogenesis.

We investigate how syndecan-1 regulates AT2 senes-
cence through EVs.
Methods: Bleomycin was intratracheally given into WT
and Sdc1-/- mice. At day 21, lungs were processed for
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and western blot
(WB). EVs were isolated using ultrafiltration centrifuga-
tion method. Human (A549) and mouse (MLE-15) lung
epithelial cell lines were used for in vitro experiments.
Results: scRNAseq analysis indicated while bleomycin
stimulated an overexpression of cellular senescence-
specific genes on AT2 cells of WT mice, these genes
were significantly downregulated on Sdc1-/- AT2 cells.
Senescence proteins, p16 and p21, were also less
expressed in the lungs of Sdc1-/- than of the WT
mice by WB. To determine the functional effects of
EVs in BAL, A549 cells were treated with human IPF
or control lung wash-EVs and evaluated for beta-galac-
tosidase activity. We found that IPF-EVs markedly
increased
beta-galactosidase
enzymatic
activity.
Corroborating
with
these
data,
bleomycin-injured
BAL-WT-EVs also significantly upregulated senescence
marker, p21, by WB on MLE15 cells whereas Sdc1-/-
-BAL-EVs inhibited p21 expression.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data indicate that syndecan-
1 regulates lung fibrosis through the senescence signalling
pathway on AT2 cells. Furthermore, syndecan-1 controls
AT2 senescence mediating through extracellular vesicles
in the BAL. Lastly, the most likely cargo molecules med-
iating this process are microRNAs.

Immortalized cardiosphere-derived cell EV-associated piRNA, imEV-Pi,
protects against ischaemic injury in the heart
Alessandra Ciullo, Ahmed Ibrahim, Liang Li, Chang Li, Weixin Liu and
Eduardo Marbán
Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, USA
Introduction: Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are a
population of heart-derived progenitors with demon-
strated therapeutic efficacy in preclinical and clinical set-
tings. CDCs function by secreting extracellular vesicles
(EVs), lipid-bilayer nanoparticles laden with bioactive
molecules. Recently our group developed a strategy for
immortalizing CDCs (imCDC) that retains their thera-
peutic potential and enhances CDC function indirectly
through their secreted EVs. imCDC show a different
RNA
content(miRNA,
mRNA,
rRNA,
tRNA
and
piRNA) compared to primary CDC. In particular, we
focus on Piwi RNAs (PiRNAs), small RNAs bound by
Piwi proteins, important regulators of both the epigen-
ome and transcriptome. We seek to explore the role of a
PiRNA highly enriched in imCDC-EVs (imEV-Pi).
Methods: EVs are prepared by conditioning cells for
24 hrs in serum-free basal media, in hypoxic culture.
After 24 hrs conditioned medium is cleared of cellular
debris and EVs isolated using ultrafiltration by centrifu-
gation (ufc). Fractions were analysed in terms of particle
size, number, and concentration and piRNA content. In
vitro, bone marrow derived-macrophages (BMDM) were
exposed to imCDC-EV, imEV-Pi and control and tran-
scriptomic profile and potentially activated pathways
were assessed. In vivo, 8–10 week-old Wistar-Kyoto
female rats received 10^10 imCDC-EV, imEV-Pi, scram-
ble or vehicle intracoronary 20 minutes after ischaemia-
reperfusion(I/R). Cardiac Troponin I levels, scar size and
monocytes were assessed at 24 and 48 hrs.
Results: By small-RNA sequencing analysis we found that
piRNAs are enriched in both CDC-EV and imCDC-EV.
imCDC show a different PiRNA composition compared to
primary CDC. imEV-Pi was identified as one of the most
highly-expressed non-coding RNAs (the number of reads
were 35X higher in imCDC-EV compared to CDC-EV). In
vitro, imExo-Pi-conditioned BMDM exhibit a different
transcriptomic profile compared with control, with upre-
gulation of pathways involved in the inflammatory
response, cell death, and cell-to cell signalling. In vivo,
imEV-Pi is cardioprotective, as shown by reduced scar
size and lower cardiac troponin levels compared to vehicle-
and scramble-injected animals at 48 hrs post I/R. imEV-Pi
only minimally alters neutrophil counts profile in blood
but it alters monocytes profile with a decreased number at
24 hrs and an increase at 48 hrs.
Summary/Conclusion: We posit that imEV-Pi is a key
determinant of imCDC-EV therapeutic efficacy. Our
results indicate that target cells may be macrophages/
monocytes, given that imEV-Pi exposure modifies their
composition and mRNA profile both in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (exosomes, EVs)
are cell membrane particles (30–200 nm) secreted by
virtually cells. During intercellular communication in
the body, secreted EVs play crucial roles by carrying
functional
biomolecules
(e.g.,
microRNAs
and
enzymes) into other cells to affect cellular function,
including disease progression and tissue regenerations.
Literature previously reported that the macropinocyto-
sis pathway contributes greatly to the efficient cellular
uptake of EVs. The activation of growth factor recep-
tors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
induces macropinocytosis. In this study, we demon-
strated the effects of EVs on demal papilla and hair
follicle regeneration.
Methods: Identification of distinct nanoparticles and
subsets of extracellular vesicles from umbilical cord
blood

Results: The effects of EVs from umbilical cord blood
stem cell on the propagation of demal papilla and hair
follicle regeneration were observed.
Summary/Conclusion: The enhancement of extracel-
lular vesicles from umbilicalcord blood stem cell the
propagation of demal papilla and hair follicle regenera-
tion were observed and confirmed.

Introduction: Bacterial pore-forming toxins (PFTs)
are major virulence factors produced by pathogens.
PFTs target host plasma membrane (PM) and create
transmembrane pores, which allow uncontrolled flux
of ions and small molecules across the PM disrupting
cellular homoeostasis. To survive, cells display poorly
understood repair mechanisms to recover the cell
homoeostasis. Several mechanisms were proposed to
participate in cell recovery: exocytosis of cortical lyso-
somes; endocytosis of PFTs pores; PM blebbing and
shedding.
Methods: We used increasing concentrations of pur-
ified PLY to intoxicate cells. PM permeability was
assessed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide
dye. Cytoskeleton rearrangements were investigated
by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.
Extracellular vesicles released during PM repair were
isolated by high-speed centrifugation and characterized
by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and mass spectrometry/
liquid chromatography analysis.
Results: PLY triggers a complete reorganization of
the actomyosin cytoskeleton inducing the formation
of cortical actomyosin bundles at sites of PM remo-
delling. These structures assemble upon loss of PM
integrity
and
disassemble
as
PM
recovers.
We
detected the release of microvesicles during the
recovery of PM integrity. Vesicle population is het-
erogeneous with sizes ranging from 100 to 500 nm,
with the majority of them measuring 100–200 nm.
Vesicle proteomic analysis revealed that they contain
PLY, suggesting they participate in pore removal,
proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, PM repair
and exosome biogenesis.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that cells
are able to recover from the damage induced by sub-
lytic concentrations of PLY. Actomyosin cytoskeleton
undergo massive changes with the assembly of cortical
bundles possibly at sites of PM damage. We showed
that cells produced extracellular vesicles during the
process of repair. We are now focusing on understand-
ing the biogenesis of those vesicles and its importance
during the process of repair.

Introduction: Despite of high expectations, mesenchy-
mal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapies still lack effi-
cacy, partially due to loss of cell viability and function
upon administration. MSC-derived extracellular vesi-
cles (MSC-EV) emulate the regenerative potential of
MSC, shifting the field towards cell-free therapies.
Clinical applications require the establishment of a
scalable and GMP-compliant processes for the produc-
tion and isolation of MSC-EV, combined with robust
characterization platforms.
Methods: To develop a well-established process for the
production of therapeutic MSC-EV, we compared dif-
ferent MSC sources (bone marrow, adipose tissue,
umbilical cord matrix), culture media compositions
(DMEM
supplemented
with
foetal
bovine
serum
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific),
DMEM
supplemented
with human platelet lysate (AventaCell Biomedical)
and StemPro MSC SFM Xeno Free medium (Thermo
Fisher Scientific)) and culture parameters (oxygen ten-
sion and shear stress) in two different culture platforms
(2D static tissue culture flask vs 3D dynamic spinner
vessels). Subsequently, MSC-EV were isolated by ultra-
centrifugation or a commercially available isolation kit
and characterized according to ISEV guidelines.
Results: MSC derived from different sources/donors
were able to grow under normoxia and hypoxia in 2D
T-flasks and 3D spinner vessel culture systems, while
maintaining their immunophenotype and differentia-
tion potential, according to the minimal criteria
defined by the ISCT. The time point for pre-condition-
ing and collection of conditioned medium for MSC-EV
isolation was also optimized for both 2D and 3D
culture systems. MSC-EV were characterized according
to MISEV 2018 guidelines, using techniques as NTA,
protein and lipid quantification, western blot, imaging
and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).
The results indicate that MSC-EV derived from differ-
ent sources/donors have similar size distribution, how-
ever, EV yields tend to be higher for the 3D culture
system. Of notice, several spectral regions were identi-
fied by FTIR, enabling the detection of differences in
the biomolecules present in MSC-EV, MSC-condi-
tioned media and cells produced under different
conditions.
Summary/Conclusion: In summary, this study contri-
butes to the establishment of a scalable process for
MSC-EV production.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have great
potential in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and pro-
gression monitoring to complement the inaccurate
prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and invasive-
ness of tissue biopsy. However, current methods can-
not isolate pure EVs and therefor EVs characteristics
remain largely unknown. In order to develop an accu-
rate approach for EV isolation, we aimed to compare
three emerging methods with different characteristics
of small EVs (sEVs) from human PCa plasma samples
and to choose the best one for diagnostic and func-
tional studies.
Methods: PCa patients and age-matched healthy con-
trols (HC) plasma (n = 6 in each group) were used to
isolate sEVs with 3 different isolation methods includ-
ing commercial ExoQuick Ultra Kit, qEV 35 and qEV
70 size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Isolated sEV
were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis,

immunoblotting, cyrogenic electron microscopy, flow
cytometry (FC) and proteomics analysis. For FC char-
acterizing surface marker expression, the sEVs were
further purified by CD9 and CD81 commercial immu-
noaffinity magnetic beads . Lipoprotein was captured
by streptavidin biotinylated ApoB magnetic beads to
measuring the lipoprotein contamination.
Results: The sEV size, morphology, surface protein and
protein cargo with proteomics were analysed between
the three isolation methods. sEVs isolated from SEC
methods had a lower particle size, protein amount,
protein/sEV marker ratio and ApoB+/sEV marker
ratio than those from ExoQuick Ultra method. In addi-
tion, sEVs isolated from qEV35 demonstrated a signif-
icantly higher sEV content, more up-regulated and
down-regulated PCa proteins from proteomics but
lower sEV marker/protein ratio and a higher protein
contamination than those from qEV70. Furthermore,
sEV marker signal also showed a good correlation with
particle numbers instead of protein content in all the
methods.
Summary/Conclusion: qEV 70 method demonstrated
better performance in isolating relatively pure sEVs
from human plasma; qEV35 has the better perfor-
mance in isolating samples with higher sEV content;
ExoQuick Ultra isolated samples with closely sEV con-
tent to the qEV35 but with the highest non-sEV pro-
tein contaminations. People can choose higher sEV
content or higher sEV purity according to the down-
stream analysis.

University, Uppsala, Sweden
Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) (30–
200 nm in diameter) are secreted by most cells, including
tumour cells. They have attracted interest as biomarker
for cancer diagnostics based on liquid biopsies, because
they are abundant in body fluids and their content (pro-
teins, RNAs and other cargos) reflects their parent cells.
Moreover, sEVs may also be used for treatment monitor-
ing, as recent studies suggested that the expression levels
of certain markers may change during therapy, reflecting
tumour response. For cancer diagnostics and therapeutic
purposes in clinical settings, it is important to have a
device which allows multiplexed measurements, in
order to scan a large number of markers simultaneously
and compare the expression levels of different patients, or
same patients at different treatment stages, in a time
efficient manner.
Methods: Herein, we propose a multiplexed platform
for label-free detection and surface protein profiling of
sEVs. The technique is based on the electrokinetic
phenomena of streaming current and zeta potential
(\zeta*) and measures the\zeta* change upon sEV bind-
ing on functionalized microcapillary surfaces. For the
purpose, we used sEVs derived from lung cancer cells.
In its current form, the platform can measure up to 5
channels simultaneously, however, it can be further
expanded.
Results: Having demonstrated that our electrokinetic
sensor successfully detects sEVs in a specific way, we
tested its ability to measure the expression level of
membrane proteins. The analysis showed that it could
detect differences in the expressions of EGFR on sEVs,
with a sensitivity of 10%. We then extended the plat-
form for multiplexed analysis, by connecting and mea-
suring four capillaries, functionalized with different
capture probes, simultaneously. For the purpose, we
targeted specific tumour markers, i.e. EGFR, and exo-
somal tetraspanin family proteins, such as CD9 and
CD63. The results showed successful multiplexed EV
detection.
Summary/Conclusion: Being the sensor suitable for
multiplexed sEV detection, we shall present our inves-
tigation on a set of pleural effusion samples collected
from a cohort of lung-cancer patients with different
genetic makeup.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released to
biological fluids from different tissues and organs and they
contain molecules proposed as biomarkers for multiple
pathological conditions. However, most EV biomarkers
have not been validated due to the lack of sensitive tech-
niques compatible with high-throughput analysis required
for routine screenings. Using immunocapture techniques,
combining antibodies against tetraspanins and candidate
tumour-specific markers we have recently optimized sev-
eral assays that greatly facilitate EV characterization.
Methods: We have improved flow cytometry and
ELISA assays, increasing substantially the sensitivity
for EV detection. Using DLS, EM and analytical ultra-
centrifugation, we have characterised the biophysical
basis of this enhancement. The final methodology can
be performed in any laboratory with access to conven-
tional flow cytometry or ELISA reader.
Results: Using combinations of antibodies specific for the
tetraspanins CD9, CD63 and CD81, it is possible to detect
EVs in minimal volumes of urine and plasma samples
without previous enrichment. Additionally antibodies
against other less abundant markers, like the epithelial
marker EpCAM, have been used to capture and identify
EVs directly in minimal volumes of urine or plasma with
sensitivity higher than Western Blot analysis of isolated
EVs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that additives altering
the biophysical properties of an EV suspension, increased
detection of tumour antigens in these immune-assays.
Summary/Conclusion: The development of sensitive,
high-throughput methods, easily translatable to clinical
settings, as ELISA and flow cytometry described here,
opens a new avenue for the systematic identification of
any surface marker on EVs, even scarce proteins, using
very small volumes of minimally processed biological
samples. These methods will allow the validation of EV
biomarkers in routine liquid biopsy tests.

Introduction: When EV subpopulations are enriched
on antibody microarrays and probed for their surface
proteins, the detection signal is biased towards abun-
dant subpopulations as it is dependent on both the
protein expression level and the number of EVs cap-
tured. To address this challenge, we developed a novel
normalization approach allowing: 1) the estimation of a
target signal independent of EV subpopulation size
through dye-based EV quantification, and 2) the
assessment of subpopulation target enrichment relative
to the population average by leveraging TIM4 as an
unbiased, lipid-based EV capture. Here, we investigated
the expression of cancer-associated proteins, particu-
larly metastasis-associated integrins (ITGs), in breast
cancer EVs with varying metastatic potential and
organotropism.
Methods: The relative protein enrichment profiles for
various EV subpopulations were established from EVs
of SkBr3 (HER2+), T47D and MCF-7 (ER+PR+),
BT549 and MDA-MB-231 (triple negative) breast can-
cer cell lines, as well as five MDA-MB-231-derived cell
lines of four different organotropisms (brain, bone,
lung, liver) using our custom antibody microarrays
with our normalization approach.
Results: As expected, HER2 was broadly detected in
HER2+ SkBr3 EVs. Interestingly, HER2- T47D and
MCF-7 EVs also expressed HER2 where it was highly
enriched in its EpCAM+ subpopulations. ITG α6, β3
and β4 were only found in triple negative and organo-
tropic EVs with ITG β3 and β4 differentially enriched
based on the organotropism. The population average of
MDA-MB-231 and lung-tropic EVs had high expres-
sion of ITG β4, where subpopulations of CD44+ EVs
showed positive enrichment while CD9+ and CD63
+ EVs showed negative enrichment. ITG α5, β3 and
β4 were absent in the bone-tropic CD81+ EV subpo-
pulation, a profile atypical in other organotropisms.
Lastly, EGFR was negatively enriched in Tetraspanin+
subpopulations in MDA-MB-231 EVs, but positively
enriched in these subpopulations in organotropic
EVs, especially for brain-tropism.
Summary/Conclusion: Following normalization, we
were able to quantify specific protein associations,
uncovering a multitude of co-enrichment profiles that
characterize specific metastatic and organotropic cell
lines. Notably, we found enrichment signatures that
distinguish between different organotropisms derived
from the same parental cancer line.

Heparan sulphate proteoglycans are required for EV-mediated delivery of
multiple growth factors

Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK
Introduction:
The
tissue
microenvironment
sur-
rounding tumours is complex and the cross-talk
between cancer and non-cancer cells is essential for
tumour growth and progression. We have previously
shown that heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs),
on the surface of prostate cancer EVs, are required for
delivery of TGFβ and initiation of a disease-support-
ing fibroblast phenotype. However, HSPGs are known
to bind numerous growth factors, so here we have
explored the repertoire of such proteins tethered to
EVs by HSPGs.
Methods: EVs were isolated from DU145 prostate can-
cer cell conditioned media by ultra-centrifugation onto
a sucrose cushion. Vesicular HSPGs were modified
either by removal of heparan sulphate (HS) glycosami-
noglycan (GAG) chains using the enzyme Heparinase
III (HEPIII), or attenuation of HSPG core protein
expression
using
shRNAs
to
knockdown
specific
HSPGs within the parent cell. Differences in proteins
present in control vs modified EVs were identified by a
sensitive protein array, based on proximity-ligation
technology, and selected targets validated by ELISA.
Functional delivery of growth factors by EV-associated
HSPGs to recipient fibroblasts is being explored using a
variety of in vitro techniques.
Results: Proteome analysis identified 49 targets that
bind to HS-GAG chains, and also 108 different pro-
teins that showed altered expression following the loss
of one or more HSPGs from EVs. Using ELISA, we
have been able to quantify selected candidates on wild
type vesicles, some of these are lost following HS-
digestion. We were also able to validate proteins on
HSPG-deficient vesicles. Gene ontology analysis sug-
gests that EV HSPG-mediated delivery of growth fac-
tors is important for control of processes such as
angiogenesis, tumour invasion and immune regula-
tion. Functional validation of proteins identified is
ongoing.
Summary/Conclusion:
Here
we
demonstrate
that
HSPGs play a key role in loading of EVs with a com-
plex assortment of growth factors, and therefore sub-
sequent EV-mediated growth factor delivery. We
anticipate
that
loss
or
damage
of
EV-associated
HSPGs will result in attenuation of EV induction of a
tumour-supporting fibroblast phenotype.

machine learning approaches and studying miRNA & miRNA-target
interactions

Introduction: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth leading
cause of cancer-related death in women, partly due to
difficulty in early diagnosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
show promise for use in early diagnostics of OC. Here,
EVs from cervical mucus (CM) of ovarian cancer
patients were used for discovery of OC biomarkers
for diagnostics. Machine learning was used to mine
EV miRNA data to develop an OC biomarker panel
(validation
via
The
Cancer
Genome
Atlas).
Examination of the miRNA targets reveal that the
panel is a sufficiently accurate predictor of OC.
Methods: EVs from the CM of 48 patients (15 high-
grade serous, 24 low-grade, 7 benign) were isolated for
small
RNA-sequencing.
The
top
differentially
expressed miRNAs were used in a random forest and
“voom” (variance modelling at the observational level)
model. Unsupervised approaches were used and then
vetted against patient symptomology data. A TCGA
ovarian cancer dataset (n = 100) was used for
validation.
Results: An OC biomarker panel of 10 microRNAs
(voom: 96.55% accuracy; random forest: 88% accuracy)
was generated. The panel consists of members from the
mir-200 family and the mir-16 family, among others.
The miRNA targets are associated with molecular func-
tions and pathways specific in OC progression.
Summary/Conclusion: Our method has identified EV
miRNA biomarkers that may be crucial for early, non-
invasive detection of OC. Data science has been used to
develop a feedback system integrating biochemical
experiments, smaller datasets, and previously available
data to identify and verify a biomarker panel for OC
diagnostics.

Introduction: Liver disease has become a significant
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
among
HIV
patients. Alcohol exposure can further exacerbate
liver
damage
by
activating
hepatic
stellate
cells
(HSCs), leading to hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis,
often seen at all levels of alcohol exposure among
people with HIV. Due to the potentiating effects of
alcohol on HIV-induced hepatocytes (Hep) damage,
as well as the effect of ethanol in HSC-mediated
extracellular remodelling, it is imperative to under-
stand the interplay of Hep and HSCs. Here, we focus
on
the
exosomes
released
by
HIV-and
ethanol
exposed Hep and how these exosomes modulate the
functional behaviour of HSCs.
Methods: Human hepatocyte Huh7.5CYP2E1 [hepa-
toma cells stably transfected with CYP2E1 designated
as RLW cells] were infected with HIV in the presence
or absence of alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde using
the acetaldehyde-generating system (AGS). The condi-
tioned medium was collected from 4 groups of cells:
untreated, HIV-, AGS- and HIV+AGS. Quantification
of exosomes number and size were evaluated with
ZetaView or Nanosight and further characterized for
exosome
markers
following
the
guideline
from
Minimal
information
for
studies
of
EVs
2018
(MISEV2018). The human hepatic stellate LX-2 cell
line was exposed to hepatocyte-derived exosomes and
assessed for the activation using pro-inflammatory
markers IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and fibrotic markers
ACTA2, and TIMP1 using quantitative PCR. We also
analysed exosome miRNA content in primary human
hepatocytes (PHH), which potentially regulates the
function of recipient cells by “programming” their
inflammation/fibrosis status. The network analysis for
mRNA and miRNA were carried out using Gene
ontology consortium, and mirror 2.0 and DAVID
bioinformatics resources 6.8.
Results: AGS treatment further enhanced the release of
HIV-induced exosome from hepatocytes. Size distribu-
tion assessed by zeta view or Nanosight revealed that
approximately 85–90% of particles distributed in the
range of 50 to 200 nm, with a peak at ~90 nm.
Enriched expression of HIV protein P24 was observed
in fractions F9-F12. Western blotting of hepatocyte-
derived exosome demonstrated positivity for exo-
some-enriched proteins Alix, TSG 101 and CD9 speci-
fically in F2-F8 fractions and negative for endoplasmic
reticulum protein calnexin. The uptake of Hepatocyte-
derived exosomes by HSCs was apparent as demon-
strated by immunofluorescence. The internalization of
hepatocyte-exosome induced activation of HSCs as
evidenced by increased expression of pro-inflammatory
IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα markers in the latter cells.
Summary/Conclusion: We conclude that AGS treat-
ment in HIV-infected hepatocytes potentiates the
release of exosomes, which, following uptake by the
HSCs, leads to their activation.

Antimicrobial peptide LL-37 induces neutrophil-derived extracellular
vesicles with antibacterial potential and protects murine sepsis

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released
from immune cells or other host cells upon microbial
infection modulate the immune response and thereby
regulate the infection. Sepsis is a life-threatening multi-
ple organ dysfunction caused by systemic dysregulated
inflammatory
response
to
infection.
Nevertheless,
numerous therapeutic trails concerning immune dys-
function have still been disappointing outcomes. We
have previously shown that LL-37, a human cathelici-
din antimicrobial peptide, improves the survival of
caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) septic mice. Here,

we investigated the induction of EV release by LL-37
and functions of LL-37-induced EVs in murine sepsis.
Methods: EVs were isolated from peritoneal exudates
of CLP mice and the supernatant of LL-37-stimulated
mouse bone marrow neutrophils by differential centri-
fugation or size exclusion chromatography. Isolated
EVs were analysed by flow cytometry, western blotting,
and nano particle analysis. Neutrophil-derived EVs
were injected into CLP mice to assess the protective
function of EVs against septic mice. The antibacterial
activity of EVs was evaluated by incubating with
Escherichia coli.
Results: In CLP mice, LL-37 augmented the level of
EVs. EVs from LL-37-injected CLP mice contained
higher amounts of neutrophil-derived antibacterial
proteins (lactoferrin and CRAMP, cathelicidin-related
antimicrobial peptide) and exhibited higher antibacter-
ial activity compared to EVs from PBS-injected CLP
mice. Furthermore, LL-37 stimulated mouse bone mar-
row neutrophils to release EVs with antibacterial
potential, and administration of the LL-37-induced
EVs reduced the bacterial load and improved the sur-
vival of CLP mice.
Summary/Conclusion: LL-37 induces the release of
antimicrobial EVs from neutrophils in CLP mice,
thereby reducing the bacterial load and protecting
mice from lethal septic condition.

Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) has exceeded HIV as
the most lethal infectious disease globally for two con-
secutive years, mainly due to difficulties in achieving
early and definitive diagnosis, and timely treatment.
Exosomes carrying RNA, particularly miRNA, have
demonstrated their functional and diagnostic potential
in diseases including TB. However, few published stu-
dies have explored whether exosomal miRNAs could
be used for diagnosis of TB. Thus, more systematic and
comprehensive study of exosomal miRNAs with regard
to their potential as non-invasive TB biomarkers is still
urgently needed.
Methods: We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus
database for datasets published before December 2019,
and performed meta-analysis on available exosomal
miRNA profile data for healthy control (HC) and
active TB clinical specimens . Reprocessing next gen-
eration sequencing data under uniform parameters and
utilizing state-of-the-art bioinformatics analysis.
Results: We identified many distinct up-regulated and
down-regulated differentially expressed exosomal miRNA
across multiple studies, and further screened the top 10,
which might provide a potential panel for differentiation of
HC and TB. We classified all differentially expressed
miRNAs into six expression patterns and identified two
persistently up-regulated miRNA (hsa-miR-140-3p, and
hsa-miR-423-3p) as potential markers during TB progres-
sion. Moreover, the differential expressed exosomal genes
that we screened from the datasets were consistent with the
genes overlapped with predicted mRNA targets of differ-
entially expressed miRNA. Pathway and function analysis
further demonstrated down-regulated signalling path-
ways/immune response and up-regulated metabolism
and apoptosis/necrosis.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated the
selective packaging of RNA cargoes into exosomes under
different stages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
infection, as well as facilitating development of potential
targets for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TB.

Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan para-
site that causes Chagas disease, a relevant source of
morbidity in Latin America, which has spread to
many countries as result of immigration of the people
from endemic areas. Many studies have been showed
that trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi release extracel-
lular vesicles (EV) that increase parasite infection.

Objectives. Here, we aim to test if previous immuniza-
tion with EVs in adjuvant can generate a protective
immune response by decreasing the effects of EVs in
experimental Chagas disease.
Methods: Female BALB/c mice were immunized by
intra peritoneal (ip) administration with 5 × 105 or
107 EVs isolated from trypomastigotes forms, with
aluminium hydroxide adjuvant (AlOH). Injections
were administered intravenous in 3 doses during
45 days (15 days interval). After immunization, mice
were infected intra-peritoneally with 500 trypomasti-
gotes forms. Parasitaemia was quantified by counting
motile parasites in fresh blood sample drawn from
lateral tail veins. Mortality and weight were analysed
during the infection. In control group, the mice were
immunized with AIOH.
Results: The immunization with EVs with AlOH
decreased the blood parasitaemia and the animals sur-
vived, while all animals died in the group AlOH alone.
The animals immunized with EVs had an increase of
F4/80+ CD11b+ and CD80/CD86 expression in cells
isolated from the peritoneum.
Summary/Conclusion: These results indicate that T.
cruzi EV antigens can induce an immune response
that controls the development and establishment of
the experimental Chagas disease.

Introduction: Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is a noso-
comial pathogen, of major concern due to its multi-
drug resistance (MDR) and the recent appearance of
hyper-virulent strains in the clinical setting. The World
Health Organization included Ab as a critical priority
pathogen for the development of novel antibiotics. Ab
pathogenesis is associated with a multitude of potential
virulence factors (VF) that remain poorly character-
ized. There is growing evidence that outer membrane
vesicles (OMV) are used as vehicles to transport bac-
terial proteins that contribute to set up the conditions
for the infections. In the present work we studied the
physiopathology of MDR Ab. We focused on the con-
tribution of non-characterized outer membrane pro-
teins (OMPs) associated to OMVs, with special focus
on lipoproteins (LP).
Methods: We conducted a bioinformatic prediction using
available datasets to construct a list of OMV-associated
OMPs putatively acting as VF in AB5075. Seven genes
were selected and the corresponding mutants were
obtained from Manoil Lab collection. Physiological ana-
lyses of the mutants were performed, and the involve-
ment of the selected proteins in Ab pathogenesis was
evaluated by adherence, invasion, and cytotoxicity assays
on human lung cells A549.
Results: Biochemical analysis indicated similar growth
rates in rich media, as well as similar levels of OMV
production for all the mutants as compared to WT.
Also, no differences in susceptibility to chaotropic
agents were observed, indicating no alteration of the
OM function as a general permeability barrier. All
mutants similarly reduced A549 cell viability, but to a
lesser extent than the WT. Moreover, three of them
exhibited less adhesion and invasion compared to the
WT, and OMV isolated from these mutants displayed
variable levels of cytotoxicity.
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest roles for
the mutant gene products in Ab pathogenesis and
contribute to the better understanding of Ab virulence
mechanisms, revealing novel possible targets for ther-
apeutic development.

Introduction: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei)
grows as a mycelial form in the environment but
multiplies rapidly as a yeast form in the host and
within macrophages. The yeast can cause dissemi-
nated
and
progressive
infections
or
lethal
Talaromycosis. But the mechanisms of pathogenicity
of T. marneffei are poorly understood. Fungal extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) have previously been shown to
transmit a proinflammatory message to macrophages.
However, the characteristics and effects of T. mar-
neffei EVs on the progress of infection have not yet
been investigated.
Methods: In this study, EVs of T. marneffei yeasts were
isolated by ultracentrifugation method. EVs were
detected and confirmed by Electron microscopy and
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The RAW 264.7
murine macrophages were incubated with the T. mar-
neffei vesicles to observe the changes of macrophage
morphology and function, especially in inflammatory
response. The proteins, DNAs, RNAs of T. marneffei
vesicles were respectively removed with protease,
DNase and RNase. All treated EVs were used to incu-
bate with murine macrophages observe the effect on
macrophages in inflammatory response.
Results: We observed that EVs secreted by T. mar-
neffei have a typical spherical shape with a diameter
of 30 to 200 nm. T. marneffei EVs were internalized
by RAW 264.7 murine macrophages and promoted
the production of NO and proinflammatory cytokine
by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. T.
marneffei EVs stimulate macrophages to generate
Reactive oxygen species (ROS). Addition of T. mar-
neffei EVs to macrophages also promoted transcrip-
tion
of
the
M1-polarization
marker
CD86
and
diminish
that
of
the
M2
markers
CD206.
Incubation of T. marneffei vesicles with murine
macrophages resulted in increased levels of extracel-
lular interleukin-1β(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
interleukin-12 (IL-12). The proinflammatory effect of
vesicles was weakened when the proteins of the vesi-
cles were destroyed. In contrast, no similar changes
were observed in degraded DNA and RNA.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results indicate that the
extracellular vesicles of T. marneffei can stimulate
macrophage towards to M1 polarization phenotype
and promote proinflammatory function.

Introduction: Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite
Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is a neglected tropical dis-
ease affecting about 8 million people worldwide. Currently,
one of the main clinical problems is the lack of effective
biomarkers for therapeutic response and disease prognosis
during chronic infections. In that context, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) are raising attention as novel, minimally
invasive, and inexpensive method for diagnostic and
screening of diseases, as well as a new source to identify
new biomarkers. The main objective of this study is to use
EVs derived from biological fluids of chronic CD patients
for identifying novel biomarkers, specifically in the context
of therapeutic response and disease prognosis.
Methods: Plasma, saliva and urine from a cohort of
chronic CD patients are being collected before and at
the end of benznidazole treatment. As negative con-
trols, healthy donors have been also included. The
purification and characterization of the EVs was per-
formed by size exclusion chromatography, followed by
nanoparticle tracking analysis, bead-based flow cyto-
metry assay and transmission electron microscopy. A
proteomic analysis of the EVs was also performed.
Results:ProteinsassociatedwithEVssecretedby infectiveT.
cruzi have been previously identified in cell culture, but
never in human samples. Our results, based on the analysis
of a single heart-transplanted patient with chronic CD,
showed the presence of T. cruzi and human proteins speci-
fically associated with plasma-derived EVs. Noticeably, sev-
eral human and parasite proteins identified in EVs obtained
from plasma samples, were present or upregulated before
chemotherapy and were absent or downregulated following
treatment. Currently, proteomics analyses are being per-
formed with higher numbers of CD plasma samples.
Summary/Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first proteomic profiling of plasma-derived
EVs from a heart-transplanted patient with chronic
CD. These results thus open the possibility of using
EVs from biological fluids as a tool for the identifica-
tion of new biomarker candidates in chronic CD. These
biomarkers
are
essential
for
assessing
disease

Introduction: Eukaryotic cells communicate with
one another through multiple pathways. An estab-
lished route of communication between eukaryotic
cells is via the production of a range of different
membrane bound signalling “packages”, called extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are produced by all
domains of life and carry proteins, nucleic acid
(RNA and DNA), and other biological material, tra-
velling between cells and around the body to deliver
a range of chemical messages. Bacteria can also pro-
duce EVs that communicate with each other to co-
ordinate population behaviour, as well as with eukar-
yotic cells to stimulate host defence or induce toler-
ance. Here I investigate the poorly explored axis
where
EVs
are
the
vehicle
for
communication
between eukaryotic cells and bacteria.
Methods: As a first step, I have isolated EVs from tissue
cultured eukaryotic cells grown in Advanced RPMI
media with minimal EV-depleted FBS. NanoEVs were
isolated from spent culture media using sequential cen-
trifugation (2,000 × g, 10,000 × g) and concentration (100
kDa filter) before purifying using size exclusion chroma-
tography columns. NanoEV-rich fractions were pooled
based on particle (Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis) and
protein quantity data. NanoEVs were characterised by
electron microscopy and expression of exosomal mar-
kers. Eukaryotic nanoEVs were then characterised in

Introduction: Hydrogen sulphide (H2 S) is as a critical
endogenous gasotransmitter with antiviral and anti-
inflammatory
activity
against
respiratory
syncytial
virus (RSV) infection. Extracellular vesicles (EVs),
novel mediators of cell–cell communication, have the
potential to modulate cellular responses of recipient
cells following a variety of stimuli. In this study, we
investigated the composition/function of EVs derived
from airway epithelial cells treated with GYY4137, a
slow-releasing H2 S donor, and whether GYY-derived
EVs can alter airway epithelial cell response in recipient
cells following RSV infection.
Methods: EVs were isolated from untreated (control
EVs) and GYY4137 treated (GYY-EVs) A549 cells, a
human alveolar type II–like epithelial cell line. EVs
were purified using a two-step enrichment procedure.
EVs were characterized using particle sizing (size and
concentration) and Western blot for the EV markers.
Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining
were used to investigate presence of multivesicular
bodies (MVBs), EVs precursors, in both groups.
Recipient A549 cells were cultured for 24 hours in the
presence or absence of control- or GYY- EVs, then
infected with RSV for 24 hours. Viral titres by plaque
assay were measured in recipient infected A549 cells.
Results: We confirmed the presence and purity of our
EVs. We found that GYY4137 reduced the particles
number of EVs, but did not change EV size. A549
cells treated with GYY4137 showed an accumulation
of MVBs/lysosomes-like structures, as well as an
increase in CD63 expression, a MVBs marker, com-
pared to untreated cells. Recipient A549 cells treated
with GYY-EVs showed lower viral replication than
control EV-treated cells in response to RSV infection.
We are currently investigating the potential mechanism
for this observation and characterizing the RNA cargo
composition of GYY-EVs.

Summary/Conclusion: No vaccine or effective treat-
ment is currently available for RSV. Cellular pretreat-
ment with GYY-EVs reduced the RSV replication in
airway epithelial recipient cells, suggesting that H2 S
could exert its antiviral activity in the context of RSV
infection potentially through modulation of EV com-
position. Therefore, GYY-EVs could represent a future
novel
pharmacological
approach
for
ameliorating

Introduction: The Reoviridae family contains impor-
tant viruses that infect humans and other animals.
Reovirus is in advanced clinical trials as an oncolytic
therapeutic and has been linked to onset of coeliac
disease. Rotavirus is a leading cause of diarrhoeal gas-
troenteric mortality in children aged 5 years or younger
in the developing world. Traditionally, viruses have
been thought to transit between cells as independent
particles. This viewpoint is being challenged with the
recent discoveries that many virus families utilize
extracellular vesicles (EVs) for non-lytic transport.
EV-mediated transmission potentially enables viral
evasion of immune responses and collective transmis-
sion to drive enhanced productive infection. Recently,
rotavirus was shown to egress host cells in large EVs,
and EV-mediated transmission enhances rotavirus
virulence in vivo. Mechanisms of reovirus egress are
incompletely defined, and effects of multiparticle trans-
mission on rotavirus and reovirus genetic complemen-
tation are unknown.
Methods: Using cultured cells, microflow cytometry,
and genetically barcoded viruses, we provide evidence
that i) reovirus particles egress in large EVs in a virus
strain- and cell type-dependent manner, ii) rotavirus
upregulates EV release from infected cells, and iii) EV-
mediated transmission increases the frequency of reo-
virus genotype mixing.
Results: Taken together, these data suggest that multi-
ple particles of reovirus and rotavirus egress in large,
virus-modulated EVs, and that transmission in EVs
increases
segment
complementation
compared
to
transmission as free particles.
Summary/Conclusion:
These
discoveries
may
be
broadly applicable to viruses that travel in EVs and
will contribute to general principles of virus transmis-
sion and diversification. Continued studies will illumi-
nate
the
specific
cellular
pathways
reovirus
and
rotavirus utilize for successful egress. These pathways
may prove to be critical targets for the improvement of
vaccines and oncolytic therapy.

Introduction: The spleen is a secondary lymph organ
that filters blood and elicits immune responses against
blood-borne pathogens, such as malaria parasites.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound par-
ticles involved in intercellular communication. EVs
play several roles in malaria ranging from modulation
of immune responses to induction of vascular altera-
tions. Here, we report the first integrated characteriza-
tion of human spleen cells using multiparameter flow
cytometry (MFC) describing subpopulations of splenic
leukocytes and red blood cells (RBCs), and studied
their interaction with plasma-derived EVs from P.
vivax patients (PvEVs).
Methods: Human spleens were obtained from organ
transplantation donors. Myeloid, lymphoid, erythroid
and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were immuno-
phenotyped by MFC. T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and
RBCs were enriched by density centrifugation and
immunomagnetic isolation. PvEVs and healthy donors
EVs (hEVs) were purified by size-exclusion chromato-
graphy (SEC) and characterized by bead-based flow
cytometry. Enriched EVs were labelled with fluorescent
lipophilic dyes and incubated with total splenocytes or
enriched
populations.
EVs-cells
interaction
was
assessed by flow cytometry.
Results: Human spleen immunophenotyping showed
that CD45+ cells included B (30%), CD4 + T (16%),
CD8 + T (10%), NK (6%) and NKT (2%) lympho-
cytes. Myeloid cells comprised neutrophils (16%),
monocytes
(2%)
and
DCs

represented 70% whereas, unexpectedly, reticulocytes
were 0.93% of total cells. In addition, we also detected
HSCs, which accounted for 0.02%. SEC separated EVs
from the bulk of soluble plasma proteins as shown by
the enrichment of CD63, CD5 L and CD71 markers.
Interaction studies showed an increased proportion of
T cells (CD4 + 3-fold and CD8 + 4-fold), monocytes
(1.5-fold), B cells (2.3-fold) and erythrocytes (three-
fold) interacting with PvEVs as compared to hEVs.
Summary/Conclusion: The integrated cellular analysis
of the human spleen and the methodology employed
here allowed in vitro interaction studies of human
spleen cells and EVs. A larger proportion of mono-
cytes, T and B lymphocytes as well as erythrocytes
was found to interact with PvEVs compared to hEVs.
Future functional studies of these interactions can
unveil pathophysiological processes involving the
spleen in vivax malaria.

Activating protein-1 and extracellular vesicles in cancer metastatic beha-
viour phenocopying
Sherif A. Ibrahima and Michele Fluckb
aXavier University Medical School – Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey; bMichigan
State University, East Lansing, USA
Introduction: Activating protein 1 (AP-1) is a dimeric
transcription factor that is formed by one member of
the Fos family and one member of the Jun family of
proteins. The expression of Fra-1 and c-Jun, two mem-
bers of the AP-1 family, is highly increased in triple-
negative breast cancer. AP-1 regulates several soluble
factors which play autocrine and paracrine roles to
enhance cancer progression and metastasis. My pre-
viously published work showed that factors secreted
by the metastatic MDA-231 cells and regulated by
AP-1 induced proliferation and migration of non-
tumorigenic MCF10A cells and the non-metastatic
MDA-468
cells
through
the
induction
of
Fra-1.
Previous studies showed that exosomes from MDA-
231 cells increased the migration and invasion of the
less invasive MCF7 cells. Proteomic comparison of the
cargo of the exosomes from these two cell lines found
that exosomes from MDA-231 tended to carry proteins
that enhance the metastatic process like vimentin. So, I
hypothesized that AP-1 controls the cargo of the
MDA-231 released exosomes so it directs its oncogenic
and metastatic phenocopying behaviour.
Methods: To study the role of AP-1, I utilized the
dominant-negative version of Fos protein named A-
Fos. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with the gene
for a flag tagged A-Fos cloned to a retroviral vector
under doxycycline (Dox) inducible promoter to pro-
duce a stable cell line (MDA231/Afos). Exosomes were
extracted from conditioned medium acquired from
Dox(-) and Dox(+) MDA231/Afos cells using ultracen-
trifugation. The presence of exosomes was confirmed
using TEM and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The
exosomes were added to serum-starved MDA468 cells.
Results: Exosomes from Dox(-) MDA231/Afos cells
increased the Fra-1 level in serum-starved MDA-468
cells. This effect was reduced in the case of exosomes
acquired from Dox(+) MDA231/Afos.
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest a role of
AP-1 both in controlling and in mediating the action of
exosomes from MDA-231 cells on non-metastatic cells.
My plan is to explore the cargo of the exosomes regu-
lated by AP-1 to transfer the malignant and the meta-
static properties of MDA-231 cells. I will use RNAseq
and proteomic analysis to analyse the content of MDA-
231 exosomes in the presence and absence of A-Fos.

Introduction: Bone marrow (BM) is the major target
organ for neuroblastoma (NB) metastasis and its invol-
vement is associated with poor outcome. Yet, the
mechanism by which NB cells invade BM is largely
unknown. Tumour microenvironment represents a
key element in tumour progression and mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSCs) have been recognized as a funda-
mental part of the associated tumour stroma. Here, we
explore the potential role of NB-derived exosomes in
induction of a pro-osteogenic phenotype on BM-MSCs.
Methods: In this prospective study, we assessed the
osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs isolated from
patients with and without BM metastasis. Expression
profiling of exosomal microRNAs was performed on 8
NB cell lines by Q-PCR. MiR-375, represented the

main candidate related to the osteogenic phenotype. Its
over- and down-regulation was performed in vitro.
MiR-375 was then evaluated in plasma (peripheral
and BM derived) and BM biopsies of NB patients.
Results: BM-MSCs isolated from NB patients with BM
involvement exhibit a greater osteogenic potential than
MSCs from non-infiltrated BM. We show that BM
metastasis-derived NB cell lines secrete higher levels
of exosomal miR-375, which promotes osteogenic dif-
ferentiation in MSCs. Clinical data demonstrate that
high level of miR-375 correlate with BM metastasis in
NB patients.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings suggest a poten-
tial role for exosomal miR-375 in determining a
favourable microenvironment in BM to promote meta-
static progression. MiR-375 may, thus, represent a
novel biomarker and a potential target for NB patients
with BM involvement.

Introduction: Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are nano-
sized particles delimited by a lipid bilayer which trans-
fer functional molecular cargos from the cells of origin
to target cells. This intercellular crosstalk controls both
physiological and pathological conditions. Given their
presence in body fluids and their characteristics, these
nanocarriers might be potentially used in diagnostics
and/or therapy. Breast Cancer is the most frequently
diagnosed malignancy and ranks as the leading cause
of cancer mortality in women worldwide; the triple
negative breast cancer, in particular, is the most aggres-
sive subtype with a poor prognosis. Since it is recog-
nized that cell stiffness of cancer cells play a crucial role
during the metastatic spreading, we set ourselves the
goal of clarify the effects and the activity of small-EVs
(i.e. with a diameter below 200 nm) in metastatic breast
cancer, with a special attention on their correlation
with the biomechanical properties of cells.
Methods: Functional assays were performed on the
non-invasive MCF7 breast cancer cell line, before and
after the cellular uptake of small-EVs originating from
the invasive MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast can-
cer cell line. The mechanical properties (cell stiffness,
cytoskeleton organization and focal adhesions) of
MCF7 cells were investigated before and after the vesi-
cle uptake.
Results: The uptake of small-EVs derived from MDA-
MB-231 significantly reduces the Young’s modulus
values of MCF7 cell line making them more invasive.
Moreover actin and focal adhesion variations were
observed in MCF7 cells before and after small-EV’s
uptake, suggesting a molecular rearrangement inside
MCF7 cells upon uptake.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
results
evidence
that
small-EVs play a key role in altering biomechanical
properties of target cells and underline their relevance
in cell-cell crosstalk. Our approach is very promising to
identify new molecular mechanisms through which
EVs perform their oncogenic function.

Introduction: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the sec-
ond leading cause of cancer death in the western world.
Over 50% of the CRC patients develop liver metastasis
(LM) and 90% will die from metastatic disease. In the
current clinical setting, liver resection provides the only
possible cure, but only 20% of CRCLM patients are
resectable. The combination of angiogenic inhibitors
with chemotherapy is used to downsize CRCLM with
the goal of converting unresectable patients to resect-
able ones. However, only 10–15% of these patients can
be successfully converted to a resectable state. We have
no way of identifying those CRCLM patients that
would respond/benefit to the addition of anti-angio-
genic therapies (e.g. Bevacizumab: Bev)). Proper strati-
fication

that CRCLM patients with predominant angiogenic
lesions receiving Bev plus chemotherapy have a more
than double 5-year overall survival compared to
patients with non-angiogenic lesions. Therefore, non-
angiogenic lesions do not respond to angiogenic inhi-
bitors. Our study focuses on stratifying angiogenic vs
non-angiogenic lesions of CRCLM through extracellu-
lar vesicle miRNAs. We are using two approaches in
the selection of miRNAs to target: 1. Text mining of
published EV miRNA from CRCLM patients; and 2.
Differentially expressed miRNAs present in tumour
tissue from both lesion types, we have obtained by
sequencing 50–60 patients. These two strategies will
generate a list of miRNAs that we will target using
qPCR on plasma-derived EV miRNA from the patients
used in approach 2, where we have classified the lesions
in the patients. Preliminary data on 10 patients will be
presented.
Methods: EV isolation was performed using the gold
standard centrifugation method. RNAseq and qPCR
are used to generate the expression profile for angio-
genic vs non-angiogenic type of CRCLM.
Results: The research is under progress.

Introduction: It is known that bone metastasis causes a
reduction in the quality of life of cancer patients due to
fractures and nerve compression. Therefore, it is
important to elucidate the mechanism of bone metas-
tasis and develop new treatments. Metastatic bone
tumours occur at particularly high rates in cancers of
the prostate, breast, and lung. In this study, we focused
on extracellular vesicles (EVs) in bone metastasis, and
investigated that the role of EVs derived from cancer
cells in osteolysis.
Methods: The prostate, breast, and lung cancer cell-
derived EVs were added to osteoclast precursors with
RANKLs. The osteoclast differentiation was evaluated
by Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain
and by measuring the expression level of osteoclast
markers using by qRT-PCR. A proteome analysis
(LC-MS/MS) and siRNA approaches were used to
identify molecules which are responsible for promotion
of osteoclast differentiation in the prostate cancer cell-
derived EVs. To investigate whether the molecules are
suitable for the detection of bone metastasis in serum
EVs, we isolated EVs from serum of prostate cancer
patients, and analysed the protein level of the mole-
cules by western blot analysis.
Results: We found that the prostate cancer and lung
cancer-derived
EVs
significantly
promoted
the
RANKL-stimulated osteoclast differentiation. Our ana-
lysis revealed that CUB domain-containing protein 1
(CDCP1), which is a membrane protein on the prostate
cancer cell-derived EVs, was responsible for promotion
of osteoclast differentiation. Moreover, CDCP1 was
markedly detected in the EVs-derived from serum of
prostate cancer patients who had bone metastasis than
that of normal subjects. We also found that CDCP1
exits on the breast and lung cancer cell-derived EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: We showed that the EVs-
derived from bone metastatic tumours have a role in
activation of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, we revealed
that CDCP1 in the EVs is responsible for promoting of
osteoclast differentiation. These EVs could be the novel
diagnostic and therapeutic target for bone metastasis.

Introduction:
Blood
platelets
and
platelet-derived
extracellular vesicles (P-EVs) play a crucial role in
tumour growth and metastasis. P-EVs, also referred
to as platelet microparticles, are recognized as a carrier
for proteins and nucleic acids that control cell-to-cell
communication, mediate the formation of metastatic
niches and affect tumour invasion and metastasis.
Among the other factors, P-EVs contain the chemokine
receptor CXCR4, known as a co-receptor for HIV entry
but also regarded as important in cancer development
due to the importance of CXCR4/CXCL12 signalling.
Overexpression of CXCR4 was reported in various,
especially in invasive cancers, including colorectal can-
cer (CRC). CRC, the third most commonly diagnosed
cancer, is usually diagnosed at the late stage and
patient’s
death
is
mainly
related
to
metastasis.

approach. The aim of this study was to analyse the
effect of P-EVs on the levels of CXCR4 in CRC cells
on various epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition stage.
Methods: We used CRC cell lines HT29 and SW620,
which represent distant invasive potential and differ-
ent phenotypes, epithelial and strongly mesenchymal,
respectively. P-EVs were isolated from outdated con-
centrates of human blood platelets after activation by
thrombin in the presence of calcium ions, by subse-
quent centrifugation and ultracentrifugation. The P-
EVs were labelled using PKH67 fluorescent dye to
visualize their uptake into cell lines by confocal
microscopy. We also quantified the levels of CXCR4
in HT29 and SW620 by Western blot analysis. The
effect of P-EVs uptake on the migration of CRC cells
was studied by “wound healing” method.
Results: We found that the levels of CXCR4 in CRC
lines used in the study were correlated with their EMT
stage. We show here that P-EVs released by activated
platelets were incorporated into both HT29 and SW620
cell lines. The expression of CXCR4 in HT29 was
increased after the uptake of P-EVs. Additionally we
observed that migration rate of HT29 cells with incor-
porated P-EVs was elevated as compared to control
cells.
Summary/Conclusion: We posit that circulating P-
EVs can be incorporated into yet not invasive CRC
cells to significantly increase the level of CXCR4 recep-
tors and that may lead to the their more invasive
characteristics.

Introduction: For cancer therapy it is important to
identify markers and key processes induced during
cancer
progression.
One
of
them
is
epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is associated
with cell acquisition of invasiveness, stem cell char-
acteristics and resistance to apoptosis and therapy.
Also the extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from
tumour cells, which can be taken up by cells consti-
tuting pre-metastatic niches, can alter cancer progres-
sion by promoting cells’ reprogramming. Our group
has recently reported that Snail transcription factor, a
key factor of EMT, when overexpressed in CRC HT29
cells, drives their early EMT and alters the expression
of microRNA (miRs). In the present study we ana-
lysed the miRs profile of EVs released from those
cells.
Methods: EVs from three HT29 clones stably overex-
pressing Snail and from control HT29-pcDNA were
isolated by differential centrifugation and ultracentri-
fugation of conditioned media after 24 h of culturing in
serum-free medium. Total RNA was isolated and next-
generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of the miRNAs
was performed followed by Gene Ontology (GO)
Enrichment Analysis.
Results: MiRs profiling shows that overexpression of
Snail in HT29, while does not affect the global miRNAs
content of EVs, significantly triggers changes in indivi-
dual miRs levels. Three miRs: miR-205, let-7i and miR-
130b were upregulated and five miRs: miR-1246, miR-
3131, miR-375, miR-552-3p, miR-552-5p were decreased
in HT29-Snail-EVs in comparison to control EVs. We
also report the top Biological process and Molecular
functions and cellular compartment that are GO terms
associated with differentially expressed microRNAs.
Summary/Conclusion: We show here that EVs from
CRC cells undergoing partial EMT driven by Snail,
have different miR profile as compared to control
cells. Particular miRNAs are considered to be either
tumour suppressor or oncogenic thus changes in their
profile need to be taken into account during the cancer
treatment. The EVs miRNA profile may also serve as a
marker of CRC progression.

Methods: After isolation and purification EVs using
ultracentrifugation from conditioned media of bone
metastatic co-opting prostate cancer cells and normal
cells, total RNA was extracted. Subsequent to library
preparation and small RNA-Seq, differential gene
expression analysis was performed. Data were filtered
by mean miRNA expression of ≥50 reads, two fold up
or down regulation between 2.5 −7.5 and adjusted p-
value ≤0.05. The uptake of PCa-sEVs was performed.
Three candidate miRNAs (has-miR-200 c-3p; has-miR-
1275; has-miR-383-5p) were internalized and osteo-
blast differentiation were detected by qPCR, histo-
chemical staining and protein activity detection.
Results: Total reads of miRNAs in bone metastatic
co-opting PCa-EVs exceeded significantly than that
in normal EVs (p < 0.001), indicating that miRNAs
delivered by PCa cells play critical role in PCa bone
metastasis. PCa-CM enhanced osteoblast differentia-
tion and can be reversed by GW4869. The uptake of
PCa-EVs by MC3T3-E1 was efficient. The high
expression of the three candidate miRNAs in PCa-
EVs was verified by qPCR. All the three candidate
miRNAs promoted osteogenesis, verified by mRNA
expression
of
osteoblastic
markers
(ALP,
OCN,
RUNX2, OSX), ALP activity, ALP staining and
Aliza Red S staining.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings suggest that
miRNA cargos in PCa-EVs play a pivotal role in
the development of osteoblastic bone metastasis of
PCa, which can be potential early biomarkers and
therapy targets for prostate cancer bone metastasis.

Introduction: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common
intraocular cancer of childhood. Despite recent advances
in conservative treatment have greatly improved the
visual outcome, local tumour control remain difficult in
presence of massive vitreous seeding. Thus, the identifi-
cation of new biomarkers is crucial to design more effec-
tive therapeutic approaches. Traditional biopsy has long
been considered unsafe in RB, due to the risk of extrao-
cular spread. Exosomes, nano-sized vesicles containing
nucleic acids and proteins, represent an interesting alter-
native to detect tumour-associated biomarkers. The aim
of this study was to determine the protein signature of
exosomes derived from RB tumours (RBT) and vitreous
seeding (RBVS) primary cell lines.
Methods: Exosomes from 4 RBT (HSJD-RBT1, HSJD-
RBT2, HSJD-RBT5, HSJD-RBT14) and 3 RBVS (HSJD-
RBVS1, HSJD-RBVS3, HSJD-RBVS10) cell lines were
isolated by high speed ultracentrifugation. Vesicles
number and size were confirmed by NanoSight and
Scanning Electron Microscopy. Protein content was
analysed by bicinchonic-acid assay and high resolution
mass spectrometry.
Results: A total of 5666 proteins were identified. Among
these, 5223 and 3637 were expressed in exosomes RBT
and one RBVS group respectively. Gene enrichment ana-
lysis of exclusively and differentially expressed proteins
and network analysis identified identified in RBVS exo-
somes upregulated proteins specifically related to inva-
sion and metastasis such as proteins involved in
Extracellular Matrix (ECM) remodelling and interaction,
resistance to anoikis and metabolism/catabolism of glu-
cose and aminoacids.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, in this study, we
isolated exosomes from RB primary tumour and vitr-
eous seeding cell lines and characterized their content
with a proteomic approach. This is the first evidence
describing a proteomic exosome signature specifically
associated with vitreous seeding in RB. This character-
ization may represent a starting point for future ana-
lyses
that
allow
defining
exosomal
markers
as
promising diagnostic and potential prognostic markers
in RB as well as therapeutic targets.

Introduction: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the main intrao-
cular tumour in adults, and is particularly resistant to
treatments when disseminated to the liver. Our hypoth-
esis is that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the
primary tumour are priming the liver stroma for meta-
static cell colonization by activating hepatic stellate cells
(HSteCs). This study aimed to characterize EVs from UM
cells, and to determine their interactions with liver cells.
Methods: EVs were isolated from cell lines derived from
ocular tumours and liver metastases by differential cen-
trifugation. Their concentration/diameter range were
determined by high-sensitivity flow cytometry. Cryo-
TEM combined with receptor-specific gold labelling
was used to reveal the morphology/size of melanomic
EVs. The presence of melanoma and EV markers was
assessed by Western blotting. The internalization of
fluorescent melanomic EVs in HSteCs and their subse-
quent activation were assessed by confocal imaging
using alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and
phalloidin stainings. EV impact on invasion was mea-
sured with a tumour spheroid model embedded in
extracellular matrix. Melanomic EVs were inoculated
into the retro-orbital sinus of immunodeficient mice to
study their selective organ distribution.
Results: Melanomic EVs were positive for Annexin-5, tet-
raspanins, as well as some melanoma markers. Stellate cells
with internalized melanomic EVs expressed more alpha-
SMA, reflecting their activation. Adding EVs on tumour
spheroids increased the invasion process. Melanomic EVs
were localized into different murine organs, but mainly
into the liver, as observed by in vivo fluorescent imaging.
Summary/Conclusion: Metastatic UM cells produce EVs
that can reach the liver and activate stellate cells. Analysis
of plasmatic EVs collected from UM patients should help
designing new strategies for monitoring the progression
of this cancer and its therapeutic response.

Introduction:
The
understanding
of
interaction
mechanisms between cancer cells and the tumour
microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing
therapies that can arrest tumour progression and
metastasis. CAFs are the major constituent of the
TME in many cancers. Recent studies indicate that
exosomes harbour the potential to regulate prolifera-
tion, survival and immune status in recipient cells.
Most of the current studies are focused on cancer cell
secreted exosomes; and little is known about CAF-
derived exosomes and their influence on cancer cells.
Methods: NSCLC cell lines (PC9GR) and MRC5 (normal
fibroblast cells) were grown in culture with exosome-free
FBS. Cutured media was filtrated by Tangential Flow
Filtration Systems. Exosomes in supernatant were iso-
lated with the ExoQuick-TC™system. Considering the
important role of cell extrinsic factors on cell growth
and survival, we assessed whether factors contained in
the MPA exosome could affect proliferation and survival
of recipient cancer cells. Cells were then treated with
1 μM Osimertinib or PBS for 3 days prior to cell quanti-
fication of live cells.To investigate mechanisms of resis-
tance to osimertinib mediated by MA or MPA-Exosome
in NSCLC cell lines, we test cell viability by crystal violet
assay in Trametinib or Osimertinib treated after pre-
treated MA or MPA-exosome, PC9GR during 6 days.
We will investigate how MPA-exsomes activate ERK
signalling pathway in PC9GR cells to induce antitumor
effects by western blot.
Results: MPA exosome increased proliferation of
PC9GR cells by more than 50% compared to control
PBS. PC9GR cells grown in MPA-exosome and subse-
quently treated with osimertinib showed a significant
increase in cell survival compared to PC9GR cells
grown in MA-exosome. Osimertinib is used to treat
EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
with tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance mediated by
the EGFR T790 M mutation.These data show that
“MRC5-PC9GR-crosstalk factors” affect proliferation
and adaptive drug resistance of cancer cells. MPA-
Exosome mediates ERK signalling activation and atte-
nuated after treatment of 1uM osimertinib.
Summary/Conclusion: CAFs support cancer growth
and invasion. Co-cultured NSCLC with MRC5 lung
fibroblast increased cell viability and exosomal miR-
21
through
the
TGF-ß
pathway
in
treatment
Osimertinib. Exosomal miR-21 up-regulation in co-
cultured NSCLC with MRC-5 induced drug resistance
to drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, exosomal miR-21
expression in co-cultured NSCLC with MRC5 may
support drug tolerance persister cells.

Introduction: Exosomes are being tested for their use
as therapeutic agents in degenerative and chronic dis-
eases. However, the optimal source of exosomes is
currently under investigation. Amniotic fluid (AF) is
a naturally-rich source of exosomes that is easily
obtained for use in regenerative medicine. Organicell
Flow™is a minimally-manipulated, acellular product
derived from human AF and consist of over 300 cyto-
kines/chemokines as well as exosomes derived from the
amniotic membrane and surrounding tissues. We char-
acterized the exosome fraction of our product to elu-
cidate
the
protein
cargo
of
AF
exosomes
and
demonstrate the therapeutic potential as a novel regen-
erative therapy.
Methods: The exosome fraction of our product was
analysed using Nanosight nanoparticle imaging and
MACsplex exosome surface marker array analysis.
Exosomes were precipitated using size-exclusion filtra-
tion followed by ultracentrifugation from 3 indepen-
dent products (in triplicate) and subjected to protein
lysis and preparation for mass spectrometry analysis
using the Easy nLC 1000 and Q Exactive instruments.
Tune (version 2.9) and Xcalibur (version 4.1) was used
to collect data while Proteome Discoverer (version 2.2)
was used to analyse data. Protein expression lists were
created by merging the 3 sample replicates together
and commonly expressed proteins were determined
using Vinny 2.0 vin diagram analysis. WebGestalt
tool kit classification system was used to identify top
protein function and pathway hits.
Results: Organicell Flow™contain a mean concentra-
tion of 5.24x10^11 particles/mL (n = 12) with a mean
mode size of 125.2nm (n = 12). Surface marker analysis
confirms the presence of exosome associated proteins
CD63, CD81, and CD9 in addition to a high expression
of CD133 (n = 3). The completed analysis revealed
1225 commonly detected proteins across 3 products.
The top molecular functions of identified proteins
included protein-binding, ion-binding, and nucleic
acid-binding with enzymes, transcription regulators,
and transporter proteins representing the most abun-
dant protein groups. Pathway enrichment analysis
revealed top hits for Integrin, PDGF, and P53 path-
ways. A deeper dive into the enzyme category of the
protein cargo further demonstrates the presence of
proteins that promote DNA repair such as DNA poly-
merase (beta and lambda), telomerase reverse tran-
scriptase, and BRCA1.
Summary/Conclusion: Organicell Flow™characteriza-
tion demonstrates the therapeutic potential of AF-
derived exosomes. Proteomic analysis revealed protein
cargo that may regulate various growth factor and cell-
cycle associated pathways. Furthermore, the presence
of DNA damage response proteins suggests a possible
mechanism for induction of cellular repair.

Introduction: T cell therapies have predominantly
focused on treating cancers, with the more recent
example of CAR-T cells targeting CD19+ cells in lym-
phoma patients. Despite recent success, challenges
including demand for reduced off-target toxicities,
reduced donor-donor variabilities and the targeting of
multiple malignant cell types, still remain.
γδT cells are a subset of T cells with dual innate and
adaptive qualities. This duality provides various advan-
tages over their more studied and used counterpart,
αβT cells. In the present study, we sought to compare

the immunotherapeutic potential of CAR-T cell and
γδT cell-derived exosomes as novel cell-free based
alternatives.
Methods: CD19-targeting CAR-T cells were obtained
following the isolation, expansion and transduction of
αβT cells using a lentiviral vector bearing the CAR
construct. γδT cells were isolated and expanded from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) follow-
ing innate or adaptive stimulation.
Exosomes from both cell sources were isolated after
a 3-day culture in serum-free media using ultracentri-
fugation-based methods. Exosomes were characterized
by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (determination of
size) and western blot assays (detection of the appro-
priate surface markers).
Nalm-6 (B cell precursor leukaemia) cells were used
as target cells for assessment of exosome cytotoxic/
killing function. CAR-T cell and γδT cell-derived exo-
somes were incubated at 1000 particles/target cell for
24-hours. Total viable cell counts were assessed via
imaging-based cytometry (NC-3000) utilizing acridine
orange and DAPI staining.
Results: Exosomes derived from γδT cells activated via
innate mechanisms showed significant killing of Nalm-
6 as compared to exosomes from non-activated or
adaptively activated γδT cells. In comparison, CAR-T
cell-derived exosomes showed minor killing capabil-
ities of the target cells.
Summary/Conclusion: Here, we report for the first
time that exosomes derived from CD19 CAR-T cells
and innately activated-γδT cells show/exert inhibitory
action on Nalm-6 cells. Further studies are currently
underway to identify the underlying mechanism(s)
responsible.

Introduction: Neural stem cell (NSC) therapy has
shown promise for brain repair after injury or disease
mostly through bystander effects. Nevertheless, the
translation of NSCs derived from human induced plur-
ipotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to the clinic remain con-
strained
due
to
safety
issues,
which
include
immunogenic risks, tumorigenesis potential, and incom-
plete differentiation. A way to avoid these issues is by
using extracellular vesicles (EVs) generated from NSCs,
as NSC-EVs likely have similar neuroprotective proper-
ties as NSCs and are amenable for non-invasive admin-
istration as an autologous or allogeneic off-the-shelf
product. However, this would require reliable purifica-
tion and characterization processes, and testing of EVs
for composition and biological properties.
Methods: We generated EVs from hiPSC-derived
NSCs using a combination of ion-exchange chromato-
graphy
(IEX)
and
size-exclusion
chromatography
(SEC) and investigated their composition through
small RNA sequencing and proteomics. We also per-
formed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine
their biological and functional properties.
Results: IEX and SEC facilitated purification of hiPSC-
NSC EVs nearly to homogeneity, which expressed EV
markers such as CD9, CD63, CD81, and ALIX with a
mean size of 145 nm. Small RNA sequencing revealed
enrichment of miRNAs related to different neuroprotec-
tive signalling pathways and diverse metabolic functions
consistent with their role in cell-cell communication. The
proteomic analysis identified >1,000 proteins, including
EV markers and many other proteins involved in central
nervous system function and cellular processes. The EVs
also displayed antiinflammatory activity in an in vitro
mouse macrophage assay. Intranasal (IN) administration
of NSC-EVs resulted in their rapid incorporation by neu-
rons, microglia, and astrocytes in virtually all regions of the
brain. Functionally, IN administration of NSC-EVs
reduced inflammatory activity in the brain in a model of
status epilepticus, and increased hippocampal neurogen-
esis in the adult brain.
Summary/Conclusion: Biologically active EVs with
antiinflammatory and neurogenic properties could be
purified and harvested from hiPSC-NSCs. Such EVs
also contain many miRNAs and proteins that are of
interest for brain repair after injury or disease.

Introduction: Age-related cognitive dysfunction is
associated with increased oxidative stress, low-level
chronic neuroinflammation, and waned hippocampal
neurogenesis in the brain. From this perspective, bio-
logics capable of modulating oxidative stress and neu-
roinflammation, and stimulating neural stem cell
activity in the brain might be useful as anti-ageing
interventions.
Methods: We investigated the efficacy of intranasal
administration of extracellular vesicles (EVs) generated
from cultures of rat subventricular zone neural stem
cells (SVZ-NSCs) in the middle-aged mice to alleviate
cognitive and mood dysfunction, increased oxidative
stress, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis decline
in old age. Mice were treated intranasally with NSC-
EVs once weekly for three weeks (50 billion per admin-
istration) starting from 18.5 months of age. A month
later, the animals were examined for cognitive, mem-
ory, and mood function using multiple behavioural
tests, and brain tissues were examined for oxidative
stress, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis.
Results: Object-based tests revealed that aged animals
receiving vehicle displayed cognitive impairments for
discerning minor changes in the environment as well
as for distinguishing similar but not identical experi-
ences. These animals also exhibited spatial memory
dysfunction and anhedonia. In contrast, aged animals
receiving NSC-EVs showed improved cognitive and
mood function. Biochemical analyses of brain tissues
revealed that NSC-EV treatment normalized elevated
concentrations of oxidative stress markers malondial-
dehyde and protein carbonyls and the proinflammatory
cytokine interleukin-1 beta. Moreover, NSC-EV treat-
ment stimulated increased production of antiinflam-
matory protein interleukin-10 and the antioxidant
superoxide dismutase. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed modulation of neuroinflammation typified by
reduced activity of reactive astrocytes and activated
microglia and improved hippocampal neurogenesis.
Summary/Conclusion: The results suggest that the
intranasal administration of NSC-EVs is a promising
approach for maintaining better cognitive and mood
function in ageing through modulation of oxidative
stress, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis.

Chemically modified myocytes-derived EVs for the treatment of cardiac
fibrosis.

aTokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan;
bTokyo Medical University,
Shinjuku-ku, Japan
Introduction: Myocardial fibrosis is a disorder that may
occur after cardiac injure due to a malfunction of the
cardiac remodelling. Fibroblasts resident in myocardium
are erroneously activated causing an excessive accumula-
tion of extracellular matrix, which decreases cardiac func-
tion and eventually, leads to death. It is known that
cardiomyocytes communicate with the surrounding
cells such as fibroblast and endothelial cells by extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs). The loss of this communication is
thought to play a central role in cardiac fibrosis.
Therefore, cardiomyocytes-derived EVs may be a pro-
mising a cell-free system for the treatment of fibrosis
inhibition.
Methods: A novel culture medium was stablished to
improve the expansion of primary cardiac myocytes.
This was tested using two commercially available pri-
mary myocytes cell lines. EVs were collected by serial
ultracentrifuges, and their effect on fibrosis was tested.
For that, prior to any treatment, and to mimic fibrosis,
primary cardiac fibroblast were activated overnight
with TGFβ.
Results: By the use of a defined conjunct of chemicals,
mature cardiomyocytes culture was highly improved to
ensure a high collection of EVs. Terminal differentia-
tion markers, as well as senesce apparition was delayed
in comparison to predetermined culture medium.
Interestingly, those primary cells secreted a rather
large amount of EVs, which expressed common EVs
membrane marker. TGFβ-treated cardiac fibroblasts
were co-cultured with myocytes showing a decrease
of fibroblast activation markers both at mRNA and
protein levels. Similar results were found when acti-
vated fibroblast were treated with EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the
use of EVs derived from chemically modified myocytes

Introduction: Over the last 2 decades, Mesenchymal
Stem Cell-derived exosomes have been shown to play a
crucial role in a myriad of cell function such as extra-
cellular matrix synthesis, proliferation, differentiation or
cell migration. Biological sources of exosome (heteroge-
neous or homogeneous cell population, serum, urine
etc.) have a direct influence on the content of their
cargo and their therapeutic application and potential.
In this study, we evaluated exosomes excreted from
cadaveric spine-derived cells. We hypothesized that exo-
somes derived from a bone source such as the spine, will
drive the osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells.
We also investigated their effects on inflammation in
Nucleus Pulposus cells using an in-vitro assay.
Methods: After their isolation and characterization,
exosomes derived from cadaveric human spines were
assayed for osteoinductive properties. A C2C12 myo-
blast cell line was treated with different concentrations
of exosomes and expression of alkaline phosphatase
was measured after 5 days incubation. Treatment with
BMP-4 was used as positive control.
Anti-inflammatory
properties
were
assessed
by
incubating TNF-treated Nucleus Pulposus cells with
exosomes for 3 days. qPCR analysis of mRNA expres-
sion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL1-beta, IL-8)
metalloproteinases
(MMP3
and
ADAMTS4),
and
apoptotic genes (BAX, BCL2) was used to determine
the effects of exosomes on inflammation.
Results: Spine-derived exosomes positively expressed
the exosome flow cytometry markers tested (CD81,
CD63 and CD9). The mean number of exosomes per
microgram of protein was 3.31 ± 2.33 x 108 indicating
a relatively high purity. Osteoinductive (OI) testing was
performed using different concentrations of exosomes.
The OI index of treatment of C2C12 cells with BMP-4,
2 x 108, 1 x 109, 2 x 109, 5 × 109 or 1 × 1010 exosomes
alone was 28.5, 1.0, 3.7, 7.4, 11.8 and 27.6 respectively.
Anti-inflammatory properties of exosome are currently
being assessed and will be presented at the time of the
poster presentation.
Summary/Conclusion: Administering exosomes alone
or in combination with an exogenous scaffold has the

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) generated
from
human
bone
marrow-derived
mesenchymal
stem cells (hMSCs) display anti-inflammatory and neu-
roprotective properties. Our recent study has shown
that intranasally (IN) administered hMSC-EVs incor-
porate into significant percentages of neurons and
microglia in virtually all regions of the intact as well
as the injured forebrain within 6 hours (Kodali et al.,
Int J Mol Sci, 2019). In this study, using a rat model, we
investigated the efficacy of a low dose of hMSC-EVs
administered intranasally for alleviating the abnormal
plasticity of newly born neurons and the activation of
microglia after SE.
Methods: Approximately 10 billion EVs were dis-
pensed bilaterally into both nostrils of young F344
rats that experienced two hours of Kainate-induced
SE. Animals were euthanized seven days after SE, and
brain tissue sections were processed for immunohisto-
chemical staining of NeuN (a neuronal marker), DCX
(a marker of newly born neurons), IBA-1 (a microglial
marker), and parvalbumin (PV) and reelin (markers of
subclasses of interneurons). In addition, activated
microglia were quantified using IBA-1 and CD68 dual
immunofluorescence.
Results: IN administration of EVs reduced the SE-
induced loss of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal
CA1 subfield. Also, EV administration after SE main-
tained higher levels of PV+ interneurons in the dentate
gyrus. Furthermore, EV treatment after SE modulated
abnormal neurogenesis, which was evidenced by a

decline in the percentage of newly born neurons dis-
playing basal dendrites. Besides, EV treated animals
displayed higher percentages of resting microglia
(ramified microglia), reduced percentages of activated
microglia (microglia expressing IBA-1 and CD68), in
comparison to animals receiving vehicle after SE.
Interestingly, diminished abnormal plasticity of newly
born neurons was accompanied by the preservation of
interneurons positive for reelin; a protein believed to
guide newly born neurons to their correct locations.
Summary/Conclusion: The results suggest that even a
low dose IN administration of MSC-derived EVs after
SE can limit neurons loss, dampen the abnormal plas-
ticity of newly born neurons, and modulate the activa-
tion of microglia.

Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are
neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by three
core symptoms that include social interaction deficits,
cognitive inflexibility, and communication disorders.
They have been steadily increasing in children over the
past several years, with no effective treatment. Two
percent of all ASD patients are suffering from a disorder
caused by a mutation in the shank3 gene. Shank3 is an
important synaptic protein, disruption of this gene
directly leads to cognitive and motor impairments.
During the recent decade, exosomes that derived from
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-exo) have been spot-
lighted as a promising therapeutic target for various
clinical indications, including neurological disorders.
Here we test three different autistic mice models.
BTBR as a multifactorial mice model of autism and
two different Shank3 mutated mice. The first is a com-
plete deletion of exon 22 (22q13.3) and the second is a
specific insertion mutation of Guanine to 3680 position
in the gene (insG3680) that leads to stop codon.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated using differential cen-
trifugation
protocol
and
characterized
using
the
2018MISEV guideline recommendations. Each animal
received an intranasal administration of 20ul containing
107 exosomes/µl. For intravenous administration, the
same number of exosomes, were used, injected in 100µl.
Results: All three animal models showed significant
improvement in their autistic behavioural phenotypes
following intranasal administration. The improvement
seems to be dose-dependent and was better achieved
via
intranasal
vs
intravenous
administration.
Biodistribution of MSC-exo showed accumulation in
the brain within 72 hours, yet the reduction of the
signal was observed in the kidneys, heart and lungs.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
data
suggest
that
Exosomes derived from adipose MSC, carry a thera-
peutic potential in ASD, via non-invasive intranasal
administration in three different mice models. These
data further emphasize our potential therapeutic strat-
egy to reduce symptoms of autism in clinical trials.

Introduction: Current treatment options for tendino-
pathies (chronic, painful tendon disorders), are not
able to restore the functional properties of native ten-
dons. Hence, new treatment options are sought.
The efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
therapies, which combined with a rehabilitation pro-
gramme including controlled exercise is the current
gold standard in equine tendon treatment, has been
shown to be largely due to the cells´ paracrine activity.
The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the
effect of bone marrow MSC derived autologous and
allogeneic conditioned medium (CM, full secretome)
and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on “tendon heal-
ing” in vitro.
Methods: To compare the “therapeutic” effect of MSC
derived EVs and CM, a standardized scratch assay
(wound healing assay) was performed. CM from
equine tenocytes, EV depleted medium and medium
with or without FCS served as controls.

Tendons and bone marrow aspirates were obtained
from three horses (6, 19 and 23 years) which were
euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. MSCs
were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation
and tenocytes were obtained by migration from tendon
explants. For CM and EV production, cells were cul-
tured in EV depleted medium.
EVs were harvested by a stepwise ultracentrifugation
approach and characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking
analysis (NTA), Western Blot (CD9, CD63) and
Transmission-Electron Microscopy (TEM).
Results: Western blot, NTA and TEM confirmed suc-
cessful isolation of EVs from equine MSCs. The stron-
gest positive effect on wound healing (fastest gap
closure) was achieved by MSC-CM (p < 0.0071). The
gap closure achieved with MSC-EVs was slower than
with MSC-CM (p < 0.7985) but faster than with CM of
tenocytes (p < 0.8289). Donor specific differences in
wound healing capability were shown for both auto-
logous and allogeneic application.
Summary/Conclusion:
Treatment
with
MSC-CM
resulted in significantly faster wound healing of adult
tenocytes in vitro than MSC- EVs or tenocyte-CM.
MSCs donor age shows a significant effect on gap
closure
following
autologous
but
not
allogeneic
administration.

Introduction: We have shown that research-use-only
grade (res) human iPSC-derived cardiac progenitors
(CPCres) can produce a secretome whose small-EV-
enriched fraction (sVF) can treat chronic heart failure
(CHF) in mice. GMP-compatible, scalable processes for
a CPC-derived sVF suitable for human therapeutic use
is needed.
Methods: iPSC-derived CPC were produced and cul-
tured
using
GMP-compatible,
scalable
processes
(CPCtx). Media without cells were “cultured” in paral-
lel for “virgin media” controls (MV). CPCres were
cultured as previously described. As a proof of concept,
sVFs were isolated from conditioned media by ultra-
centrifugation:
CPCtx-EV,
CPCres-EV
and
MV.
Particle size distributions/concentrations (nanoparticle
tracking analysis), protein levels (BSA), and the pre-
sence of CD-63 (ELISA) were determined. In vitro
activity was assessed by HUVEC scratch wound heal-
ing assay, and by rat and human cardiomyocyte (CM)
survival assays. C57BL/6 mice in CHF received echo-
guided myocardial injection of PBS vehicle control
(60uL, n = 11), CPCtx-EV (60uL, n = 11), or CPCres-
EV (45uL, n = 11). Change in cardiac function was
assessed by echocardiography.
Results: CPCtx-EV particle sizes were polydisperse
(mode ~72 nm) at a concentration of ~1.6e11 parti-
cles/mL (~2,600 particles/cell) and ~0.975mU CD63/ug
protein. CPCtx-EV increased wound healing, human
CM survival, and rat CM survival in vitro by 4.75x,
1.4x, and 2x, respectively over MV controls. In CHF
mice, significantly less CPCtx-EV mice, and less
CPCres-EV mice had severely progressive heart failure
(Left

Volume,

increased >14%) than PBS control mice (PBS vs
CPCtx-EV, p < 0.05; PBS vs CPCres-EV, p < 0.056),
and the Average Ejection Fraction of the PBS group
deteriorated 2.5x more than the CPCtx-EV group (−4%
vs −1.6%, respectively; ns).
Summary/Conclusion: We have a process for CPC
differentiation and production of conditioned media
suitable for use in human clinical trials from which
can be made an sVF with the potential to treat CHF,
possibly through re-vascularization or preservation of
CM viability.

Introduction: Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles that
mediate cell-to-cell communication via exchanging
molecular cargo. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) mod-
ification towards an osteogenic path can occur by
uptake of exosomes from other cells. It is less clear
whether vesicle placement in the absence of cells will
facilitate site-specific delivery through acellular transfer
of osteogenic activity. An electrospun fleece was com-
bined with bone marrow-derived exosomes in the
absence of cells to evaluate osteoinductive potential

cally neutral collagen carrier. Comparisons were made
of standard laboratory assay of osteoinductivity (OI),
and in vivo expression in a mouse calvarial defect
model.
Methods:ElectrospunType-Icollagenwaspreparedwithand

foundation base for application of the bone marrow-derived
exosomes. Individual discs of the collagen enhanced scaffolds
(3-mm) were prepared and placed in a mouse calvarial skull
defect. Animals were followed for 4 and 8 weeks. Exosomes
were isolated from qualified cadaveric human spines by dif-
ferential ultracentrifugation. Microscopic observation, quan-
titative assessment of OI with an alkaline phosphatase assay,
and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the composition,
the hybrid nature of the addition to the nano-collagen fibres.
A fluorescent protein reporter transgenic mouse model
expressing osteocalcin, Type-I collagen, Phex, and SP7
(Osterix) was evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks to determine bone
formation across the defect.
Results: ALP activity on the scaffold with HA demon-
strated an approximate tenfold increase to that of the
collagen scaffold alone. While a dose-dependent effect,
with higher doses of exosomes resulting in a greater
amount of alkaline phosphatase expression, expression
that exceeded that of the 50ng BMP-4 control. Dose
escalation from 1.5, 2, and 4E9 resulted in similar
increases in expression that was statistically greater
with the combination of the fleece with the exosome
component. Bone formation in the mouse calvaium did
not demonstrate gap closure at 4 or at 8 weeks, but did
demonstrate enhanced osteoclastivity and robust bone
remodelling at the margins of the defect.
Summary/Conclusion:
Bone
marrow-derived
exo-
somes dried into an electrospun fibrillar collagen
demonstrated in vitro osteoinductive potential that
might
provide
site-specific
placement
that
could
enhance biologic potential. With the capacity for ambi-
ent temperature storage, the provision of site-specific

becomes

demonstrate bridging bone across the defect.

Introduction: Complete spinal cord transection is a
debilitating disease that usually leads to permanent
functional impairments, with various complications
and limited spontaneous recovery. The current inves-
tigation of molecular mechanisms controlling axon
regeneration, (e.g., signalling networks and environ-
mental cues), led to new strategies to enhance axonal
regeneration. We have previously shown that intra-
nasal
administration
of
mesenchymal
stem
cells
derived exosomes (MSC-exo), cross the blood-brain
barrier and significantly ameliorate motor and beha-
vioural phenotype in several animal models of neu-
rotrauma and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Methods: MSC-exo were isolated from human bone
marrow and were loaded with phosphatase and tensin
homolog small interfering RNA (PTEN-siRNA). The
exosomes were given intranasally to rats two hours
after complete spinal cord transaction. Eight weeks
later we followed the motor function and histology
and electrophysiology study was performed in order
to reveal the connectivity and the biochemical changes
in the treated rats.
Results: We demonstrate that Intranasal (IN) admin-
istrations of MSC-derived exosomes could penetrate
the blood-brain barrier, home selectively to spinal
cord lesion via chemotaxis, and integrated in neurons
within the lesion. Furthermore, in rats with complete
spinal cord transection, MSC-exo loaded with PTEN-
siRNA silenced PTEN protein expression in the lesion
and promoted robust axonal regeneration and angio-
genesis, companied with decreased astrogliosis and
microgliosis. Moreover, the intranasal treatment par-
tially
restored
electrophysiological
and
structural
integrity, and most importantly, enabled the remark-
able functional recovery and significant improvement
in their movements.
Summary/Conclusion:
This
rapid,
non-invasive,
approach, using cell-free nano-swimmers carrying
molecules to target pathophysiological mechanisms
suggest novel strategy for clinical translation to spinal
cord injury and beyond.

Introduction: Musculoskeletal injuries have traditionally
been treated with activity-modification, physical therapy,
pharmacological agents and surgical procedures. These
modalities have limitations, as well as potential side-effects.
Over the last decade, there has been an increased interest in
the use of biologics for regenerative medicine applications
(RMA), including umbilical cord (UC) derived Wharton’s
Jelly (WJ). Despite this increase, there is insufficient litera-
ture assessing the amount of growth factors, cytokines,
hyaluronic acid (HA) and extracellular vesicles (EV)
including exosomes in these products. The purpose of
this study was to develop a novel WJ formulation and
evaluate the presence of growth factors, cytokines, HA
and EV including exosomes.
Methods: WJ was isolated from human-UC obtained
from consenting C-section donors and formulated into
an injectable form. Randomly selected samples from
different batches were analysed for sterility testing and
quantified for presence of growth factors, cytokines,
HA and particles in EV size range.
Results: The results showed all samples passed the sterility
test. Growth factors including IGFBP 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, TGF-
α, PDGF-AA were detected. Expression of several immu-
nomodulatory cytokines, RANTES, IL-6 R, IL-16, were
also detected. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
MCSFR, MIP-1a; anti-inflammatory cytokines TNF-RI,
TNF-RII, IL-1 RA; and homoeostatic cytokines TIMP-1
and TIMP-2 were observed. Cytokines associated with
wound-healing, ICAM-1, G-CSF, GDF-15, and regenera-
tive properties, GH were also expressed. High concentra-
tions of HA were observed. Particles in the EV size range
(30–150 nm) were detected and were enclosed by the
membrane, indicative of true EV.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results confirmed the pre-
sence of numerous growth factors, cytokines, HA and
EV in the WJ formulation. More studies are underway
to confirm the presence of exosomes in detected EV
using exosome-specific markers. We believe the pre-
sence of multiple factors within one WJ formulation
may play a role in reducing inflammation, pain and
augment healing of musculoskeletal injuries. This
offers a potential expanded use for RMA.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy
has demonstrated effective bone regeneration in clin-
ical studies. However, the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs
have been attributed to the secretion of extracellular
vesicles (EVs), particularly 50–200 nm small EVs
(sEVs). Here, we investigate the efficacy of MSC-sEVs
loaded in collagen sponge in the regeneration of criti-
cal-sized calvarial defects in immunocompetent rats.
Methods: sEVs were isolated from conditioned med-
ium of human MSCs and stored at −20 C. Calvarial
defects of 8-mm diameter were surgically created on
thirty-two 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats.
These rats were then randomly assigned to 2 groups
(n = 16 rats/group): defects treated with collagen
sponge containing 100 μg of sEVs in 100 μl saline
(CS/sEVs) and defects treated with control collagen
sponge containing an equivalent volume of saline
(CS/Control). At 1 and 8-week post-surgery, the cal-
varial bone samples was harvested for analyses by
micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histology,
immunohistochemistry and histomorphometry.
Results: At 1-week post-surgery, micro-CT analysis
showed little bone formation at the defect site in both
CS/sEVs and CS/Control groups. No statistical differ-
ences were observed in micro-CT and histology scores
in both groups. Interestingly, CS/sEVs group showed
significantly
higher
osteocalcin
(OCN)+
area
of
5.7
±
2.4%
than
that
of
CS/Control
group
(2.1 ± 1.3%; P = 0.003). CD31+ microvessels at sizes
≤50 µm and >50 µm in CS/sEVs group (34.4 ± 2.9 and
8.6 ± 2.1 microvessels/HPF) were also significantly
higher than that of CS/Control (18.8 ± 1.1 and
5.2 ± 1.4 microvessels/HPF; P = 0.002 and P = 0.038
respectively). By 8 weeks, CS/sEVs group displayed
enhanced new bone formation that completely bridged
the calvaria defect. In contrast, rats in CS/Control
showed limited bone formation. Consequently, CS/
sEVs group displayed a micro-CT score of 3.9 ± 0.2
which was significantly better than that of CS/Control
group (2.5 ± 0.8; P = 0.001). CS/sEVs group also
exhibited >twofold increase in bone volume, and
improved bone quality with higher trabecular thickness
and number, and smaller separation (P < 0.01),

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from
mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are promising
new agents in regenerative medicine and immunother-
apy. Considering that independent MSC-EV prepara-
tions might differ in their therapeutic function, we
have set up a functional assay allowing testing for the
potential immunomodulatory properties of indepen-
dent MSC-EV preparations.
Methods: Human peripheral blood-derived mononuc-
lear cells (PBMCs) were pooled from up to 12 different
healthy donors warranting high allogeneic cross-reac-
tivity, even following an optimized freezing and thaw-
ing procedure. After thawing, mixed PBMCs were
cultured for 5 days in the absence or presence of
MSC-EVs. Thereafter, cell morphologies were docu-
mented, supernatants were harvested for cytokines
quantification and cells were phenotypically character-
ized by flow cytometry. By analysing the expression of
a collection of different lineage and activation markers,
we selected a panel of antigens apparently being regu-
lated by MSC-EV preparations considered to be ther-
apeutically active.
Results: We observed that in the presence of active
MSC-EV preparations more CD14+ (monocytes) are
recovered from the MLR assay than in corresponding
control samples. Focusing on T cells, we learned that
active MSC-EV preparations reduced the content of
CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing activation markers
like CD54 and CD25.
Summary/Conclusion: The MLR assay allows elabo-
rated functional testing of immunomodulatory activ-
ities of given MSC-EV preparations. Currently, we are
comparing the immune modulatory capabilities of EVs
derived from distinct sources and optimize the marker
panel to distinguish discrete immune cell subtypes such
as different CD4 cell types, i.e. TH1, TH2, TH17 and
TRegs.

Introduction: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) proved effec-
tive in regenerative medicine. Numerous protocols for
its preparation and application are available in the
published literature. PRP possesses important immune,
haemostasis and regenerative factors, however, the
mechanisms of their action are yet poorly understood.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) could be one of the impor-
tant factors that would contribute to the beneficial
effects of preparations.
This study was performed as a part of a registered
randomised
controlled
clinical
trial
(Nr:
NCT04281901). PRP was used to treat chronic middle
ear inflammations. Here we present the results of PRP
analyses from 29 blood samples of volunteers with no
record of disease.
Methods: Plasma obtained from 20 ml of blood was
depleted of erythrocytes and enriched with other par-
ticles by repetitive centrifugation of samples. Flow
cytometry (FCM) was employed to monitor particle
contents (cells and smaller particles) throughout the
sample processing. The platelet gate was divided into
two parts: intact platelets and smaller particles. Identity
and morphology of particles in the preparations were
examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Standard laboratory tests of blood were performed.

Results: SEM images revealed the presence of heteroge-
neous population of particles in the preparation of PRP,
most of which were activated and partially fragmented
platelets. The population of smaller particles measured
with FCM, was identified as EVs. The erythrocyte sedi-
mentation rate was statistically significantly correlated to
the volume of plasma obtained in the initial centrifuga-
tion step (R = 0,70, p < 0,001) and to the concentration of
EVs (R = 0,82; p < 0,0001). Time from sample collection
to the preparation of PRP was negatively correlated with
the concentration of platelets in PRP and positively with
the concentration of EVs (R = 0,75, p < 0,001). Platelet
concentration in preparation samples was found to
depend on the concentration of platelets in the blood
and parameters of sample processing connected with
larger centrifugal and shear forces on the samples during
centrifugation. These include: sample volume, the size
and shape of the centrifuge tube and the distance of the
sample from the rotor axis.
Summary/Conclusion: EVs are gradually forming
upon activation and degradation of cells in the sample
throughout the sample processing. Optimal processing
may importantly contribute to the healing properties of
preparation.

Introduction: Satellite cells (SCs) are muscle stem
cells that play a central role in muscle remodelling.
Despite their therapeutic potential, SC-based thera-
pies have met numerous logistical challenges in the
treatment
of
systemic
muscle
diseases,
such
as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). SC-derived
extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs) may unlock the ther-
apeutic potential of SCs by overcoming these limita-
tions. To investigate their therapeutic potential, we
assessed the ability of SC-EVs to reverse mitochon-
drial dysfunction, a key pathological feature of DMD,
in oxidatively-damaged C2C12 and primary DMD
myotubes.
Methods: SCs from C57 mice were isolated and cul-
tured. EVs were isolated from the supernatant of SCs via
polyethylene
glycol
precipitation
and
characterized
using nanoparticle tracking analysis. The ability of SC-
EVs to deliver protein cargo to C2C12 myotubes, and
the localization of the cargo once delivered, were ana-
lysed using fluorescence microscopy. To examine SC-EV
potential to restore the function of damaged mitochon-
dria, C2C12 myotubes were treated with 50 µM H2O2
for 24 h followed by treatment with 3.12x108 SC-EVs
for 24 h. Separately, cultured dystrophic myotubes were
treated with 3.12 × 108 EVs every 24 h for 72 h. In both
sets of experiments, maximal oxygen consumption rate
(max OCR) was measured via Seahorse XF Cell Mito
Stress Test. Where appropriate, a t-test was performed
to test for statistical significance (p < 0.05).
Results: Based on estimated cell number and EV quan-
tification,
each
SC
released
approximately
2.35 × 105 ± 3.10x104 EVs/day. EVs delivered protein
cargo into myotubes within 2 h. Fluorescent labelling
of intracellular mitochondria showed co-localization of
delivered protein and mitochondria. Incubation of
myotubes with H2O2 resulted in a 42% decline in
max OCR relative to untreated myotubes. Subsequent
treatment with SC-EVs resulted in a 76% increase in
max OCR. Treatment of undamaged myotubes with
SC-EVs had no effect on max OCR. Primary DMD
myotubes treated with SC-EVs showed a 78% increase
in max OCR relative to untreated DMD myotubes.
Summary/Conclusion: SC-EVs rapidly deliver proteins
into myotubes, much of which co-localizes with mito-
chondria, and reverses mitochondria dysfunction in
oxidatively-damaged and dystrophic myotubes.

Quantitation
of
extra-cellular
vesicle
surface
markers
with
MESF
liposomes
Oleg Guryev, Elena Afonina and Majid Mehrpouyan
BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA
Introduction: Flow cytometry has been used extensively
for analysis of EV particles stained with fluorescent anti-
bodies directed to the known cell surface markers.
Quantitation of the surface markers in terms of the num-
ber of molecules or the number of antibodies bound per
specific marker has remained one of the largest challenges
in the EV research field. Changes in instrument setup as
well as changes in fluorescent antibodies from different
vendors, all impact the relative MFI values for the same
EV sample. In this work we report a standardization
method of quantitating extra-cellular vesicle surface mar-
kers with MESF liposomes.
Methods: Liposomes labelled with FITC fluorescent
dye were prepared with a BD proprietary technology.
Dynamic light scattering analysis was used for size
determination
of
the
liposomes.
BD
FACSAria™
Fusion system, modified with a small particle side
scatter module (SP SSC), was used for analysis of the
labelled liposomes by flow cytometry.
Results: We created a set of 180 nm FITC-modified
liposomes of various fluorescent intensities with a
known number of FITC molecules incorporated in
each liposome intensity. The MFI values of each lipo-
some population (intensity) had a linear relationship to
the amount of FITC used for labelling the liposome
nanoparticles, suggesting that no self-quenching of
FITC fluorescence had occurred. The number for the
FITC fluorophores for each liposome intensity was
expressed in the units of Molecules of Equivalents
Soluble Fluorochrome (MESF). A plot of MESF vs.
the fluorescent intensity of the liposomes (MFI values)
obtained from flow cytometry analysis provided a cali-
bration curve, from which the fluorescent intensity
(MFI value) of a stained EV sample can be converted
to the number of fluorophores bound (MESF value) to
the surface of the EV particles.
Summary/Conclusion: By this approach, the MFI values
of stained EV particles are converted to standardized MESF
values that are independent of instrument variation, result-
ing in further improvement of inter-laboratory standardi-
zation. Furthermore, utilization of liposomes with similar
size and refractive index to EV particles simplifies the data
evaluationand improvestheaccuracy of EV surface marker
quantitation by flow cytometry. Currently, other fluores-
cent dyes are being explored to expand the utility of MESF
liposomes with other fluorescent colours.

Introduction: The extracellular vesicle (EV) field currently
lacks a high-throughput method for accurately quantifying
EVs in solution. EV quantification has traditionally relied
on nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which is time
intensive and indiscriminately counts non-EV particles,
such as membrane fragments and protein aggregates. We
have rigorously assessed two commercially available meth-
ods for measuring cholesterol, a major lipid component of
the EV lipid bilayer, and evaluated the utility of these assays
to quantify EVs in minimally processed samples.
Methods: The Amplex® Red Cholesterol Assay and
Cedex Bio HT were used to quantify cholesterol in
EV samples via enzymatic oxidation, with dynamic
ranges of 80–8,000 ng/mL and 4–800 µL/mL, respec-
tively. Samples throughout various stages of purifica-
tion were analysed, from clarified cell culture medium
to highly purified EVs separated on an iodixanol gra-
dient. We evaluated several pre-processing methods, to
remove non-EV cholesterol content prior to analysis.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
Results: The Amplex® and Cedex Bio HT assays were
found to perform comparably for quantifying choles-
terol in purified EVs (R2 = 0.92). Importantly, choles-
terol quantification on purified EV samples, ranging
from 1e11 to 4e13 particles/mL, correlated well with
NTA measurements (R2 = 0.96). Both 45 µM filtration
or an additional 16,000 RCF centrifugation step follow-
ing clarification removed cholesterol associated with
cellular debris or other non-EV sources, allowing for
accurate quantification of conditioned medium sam-
ples or ultracentrifugation pellets (UCP) instead of
needing to rigorously purify samples with an iodixanol
density gradient.
Summary/Conclusion: Cholesterol quantitation can be
used to accurately estimate EV concentration, allowing
for rapid characterization of samples from clarified cell
culture supernatant to highly purified EVs. This high-
throughput analytical capability may enable more com-
prehensive assessment of methods to boost EV yield
through mass screening of cell culture conditions.

Introduction:
Recent
studies
show
that
tumour-
derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) greatly influence
the tumour microenvironment and impact the therapy.
In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bronchopul-
monary lavage fluid (BALF) appears to be a good
source of tumour-derived EVs, providing more accu-
rate information about the tumour microenvironment
than EVs from plasma. So far there is a lack of accurate
and standardized methods for EV quantification.
Fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (FL-NTA)
is an emerging method of EV-analysis, allowing discri-
mination of EVs and exosomes from impurities. Here
we perform an optimization of the FL-NTA method to
compare EVs from plasma and BALF of NSCLC
patients and healthy controls (NC).
Methods: EVs were isolated using homemade size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns (plasma)
and ultrafiltration or differential ultracentrifugation
(BALF).
NTA
was
performed
using
ZetaView
PMX220 (Particle Metrix) after EV-staining with mem-
brane dyes or fluorescence-labelled antibodies against
typical EV-marker (CD9, CD81, CD63).
Results: NTA scatter measurements showed a higher
total particle concentration in plasma than in BALF.
However, membrane-specific staining showed a much
greater purity of EV-preparations from BALF, where
nearly 100% of the particles detected in scatter mode
showed positive membrane-staining. In contrast, only
around 40–50% of particles in the plasma EV-prepara-
tions
were
positive
for
the
membrane
dyes.
Fluorescence-staining for EV surface marker requires
further optimization to obtain reproducible results.
Summary/Conclusion: Classical NTA using only the
scatter mode fails to discriminate between EVs, lipo-
proteins and protein aggregates. For EV-analysis from
complex biofluids like plasma, FLA-NTA and staining
for specific EV marker is necessary to receive reliable
data. BALF seems to be a better source of tumour-
derived EVs than plasma, since the obtained EV-pre-
parations show a higher purity. Improving conditions
for fluorescence-staining and NTA measurement of
EVs from plasma and BALF of NSCLC patients will
provide an additional method for quantifying and phe-
notyping of EVs.

characterize EV populations of different sizes and sur-
face marker composition, it would be highly advanta-
geous to target the vesicular nature of the detected
particles linked to a fluorescence readout.
Methods: The goal of this project is to detect EV with a
probe that is ubiquitously distributed across the surface
(or lumen) of the vesicle. Small (30–150 nm) EV pre-
sent fairly distinctive lipid membrane features in the
extracellular environment, turning the EV membrane
into a “universal” marker, and as such may serve as an
alternative marker that is complementary to canonical
EV surface markers.
Results: Here we present data on successfully staining
EV with the membrane dye Di-8-ANEPPS (Di-8) and
the luminal dye Calcein-AM. We demonstrate that EV
from different sources can be efficiently stained with
either dye, allowing the quantitative characterization of
EV in an unbiased manner using Exoviewer’s fluores-
cence mode. While both dyes certainly have their own
unique strengths, they exhibit the wanted linear corre-
lation of EV staining versus concentration. Further,
both dyes are compatible with subsequent immuno-
staining applications, allowing the user to target speci-
fic surface or luminal markers (Di-8).
Summary/Conclusion: While a large-panel screening
featuring other powerful dyes is continuously ongoing,
the current data support the notion of providing the
experimenter with a reference for total particle count
and at the same time fully exploring the larger dynamic
range of the fluorescence mode. Moreover, the univer-
sal probe will enable the user to correlate intensity and
particle
size
measurements,
thereby
significantly
improving
the
ExoViewer
platform
and
its
applications.

of extracellular vesicles via FACS

Introduction: Extracellular vesicle (EV) research is
challenged by the lack of standard protocols to identify
and distinguish between exosomes and ectosomes
being released via exocytosis or plasma membrane
shedding, respectively. Analysis of small EV popula-
tions requires high-resolution technology and can be
further improved using fluorescent labels such as car-
boxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). At
the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, CFSE is
cleaved enzymatically resulting in covalent binding of
the dye. In this study we optimized the conditions for
membrane labelling of EVs and their subsequent detec-
tion by flow cytometry to obtain a maximum yield of
intact EVs.
Methods: Using sequential centrifugation, we sepa-
rated EV subpopulations from supernatants of COLO
357 pancreas carcinoma cells based on size and mass.
After 10,000x g centrifugation, we reconstituted EVs
from the pellet. We used CFSE for EV detection and
analysed the expression of tetraspanins by FACS to
confirm the lipid bilayer structure. Furthermore, we
determined size distribution of EVs by nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA) and electron microscopy.
Detecting EVs as CFSE+ events, we quantified our
samples and investigated the impact of threshold
adjustment on EV quantification.
Results: After high speed centrifugation of cell free
supernatants, we identified CFSE+ events as EVs,
which appeared as round structures under the micro-
scope, and ranged from 80 to 40 nm in size.
Interestingly, tetraspanin markers CD9 and CD81
were detectable only on a subpopulation of purified
EVs, suggesting heterogeneity of our preparations.
For sufficient labelling of EVs, minimal temperature
variations and short incubation times correlated with
EV stability. Of note, threshold adjustment signifi-
cantly improved the sensitivity of the flow cytometer
for the detection of labelled EVs and hence, is central
for data comparability.
Summary/Conclusion: Protocol standardization is of
major importance for the use of EVs as diagnostic
markers in liquid biopsies.

the sample, its leads EV analysis uncertainty. In this
study, we applied the SPFS highly sensitive automated
system for quantitative and qualitative EV evaluation
without any sample pre-concentration and prepara-
tion step.
Methods: SPFS automated system and plastic disposa-
ble sensor had been developed by Konica Minolta
corporation in house. Anti-membrane protein (CD9,
CD63, CD83) antibody was chemically bonded on
hydrophilic polymer which was immobilized through
the gold thin film on the SPFS sensor. The concentra-
tion of standard EV materials was evaluated by the Q-
nano system before using. EV detection without pre-
concentrating was achieved by sandwich immunoassay
step in microchannel round-trip flow reaction (TAT
120 min) with the SPFS system, and ELISA was
adapted as a conventional standard method. After
SPFS highly sensitive fluorescent measurements step,
extracted and detected EV were effectively recovered by
using the recovery buffer reaction.
Results: The EV sensitivity performance between SPFS
and ELISA clearly showed a significant difference, and
the LOD of SPFS (8.3 particles/μl) method was estimated
3000 times superior to the LOD of conventional ELISA
(26,000 particles/μl). The SPFS calibration curve showed
a wide dynamic range at least over 5 logs as an additional
specificity. SPFS method also showed fine results in the
dilution linearity test with high reproducibility under the
serum/plasma sample condition. The data for recovery
test of EV expected us that highly accurate measurement
can be guaranteed under the condition of dilution about
10 times or less even in the whole blood sample. After the
SPFS measurement, extracted EV on the SPFS sensor
chip could be effectively recovered and could be analysed
nucleic acid which contains micro RNA.
Summary/Conclusion: SPFS system might have great
potential for quantitative and qualitative EV evalua-
tion. Our strategy with SPFS system for EV proteomic
and genomic profiling will be possible for applying to
EV quality control as well as a novel biomarker
development.

Introduction: Small EVs from tumour cells are known
to
promote
tumour
progression,
therefore,
it
is
expected to develop drugs that regulate small EV secre-
tion, which can be used in clinical applications.
Methods: To identify such regulators, we first devel-
oped a sensitive ELISA system for the quantification of
small EV secretion using a high-affinity EV binding
protein Tim4. By using this ELISA system, we screened
for small compounds that promote or inhibit small EV
secretion using a drug-repositioning compound library
(about 1,600 compounds).
Results: As a result, we identified eight promoters and
two inhibitors, including compound A, which signifi-
cantly reduced small EV secretion from various cell
types without affecting cell growth. We further inves-
tigated the effects of compound A on a mouse model of
osteosarcoma and found that compound A suppressed
tumour progression efficiently.
Summary/Conclusion: These data suggest that com-
pound A would be useful not only for the characteriza-
tion of small EV function but also for the clinical
therapy against tumour progression, by inhibiting
small EV secretion.

Introduction: For many years it was believed that
several proteins such as CD63, CD9 and Flotillin-1
were unique for exosomes, however recent studies
have shown that several of these markers also can be
present in other subpopulations of EVs (Kowal et al

somes (n = 3 x 3 cell lines).
Results: In total 6493 proteins were quantified, with

ESCRT and rab proteins were significantly upregu-
lated. In contrast, proteins that were upregulated in
microvesicles were involved in protein translocation
into
the

(TIMM
and
TOMM proteins), in cytokinesis, and in MICOS com-
plex.
However,

Summary/Conclusion: This study identifies several
proteins to be differently enriched in exosomes and
microvesicles. Several of the proteins suggest recently
by Kowal and colleagues, such as ADAM10 and
Mitofilin
could
be
validated. Additionally
several
novel proteins could be identified. Identifying markers
separating microvesicles and exosomes is of high
importance for the EV field and future studies will
have to validate them also in other cells to determine
if they are generic.

Sinigglia and Ana Claudia Trocoli Torrecilhas
Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil
Introduction: The cellular elements composing the
lining of brain ventricles have drawn much attention
from neuroscientists, especially the role of subependy-
mal cells in neurogenesis, but the role of ependymal
cells in brain function and disease is still neglected.
Our objective is to study the morphological aspects
of rat brain ventricles and the ependymal cells as ana-
lysed by transmission and field emission scanning
microscopy in normal or ischaemic rats.
Methods: For this purpose, male Wistar rats were sub-
mitted to 10 minutes of global brain ischaemia and
divided into two groups: a) sham-operated animals
and b) saline-treated ischaemic animals. All animals
were allowed to survive for seven days. All procedures
were approved by the ethics committee of the Federal
University
of
São
Paulo
(2018/7633081117).
Transmission and scanning electron microscopic ana-
lysis of lateral brain ventricles were done in buffered
2,5% glutaraldehyde/2%formaldehyde perfused brains.
Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for NTA analysis.
Results: The morphological characterization of brain
ventricle revealed a slight rarefaction of ciliary tufts of
animals submitted to ischaemia when compared to
normal animals. Field emission electron microscopy
revealed the secretion of vesicles by the ependymal
cilia in the lateral ventricle. Size and concentration of

Introduction: The function of mitochondria relies on
precise and effective quality controls. Neurons have
high metabolic demands and employ multiple mechan-
isms to ensure functional mitochondria. We investi-
gated mitochondrial vesicles – a less understood
quality control mechanism for mitochondria – and
assessed the effect of cellular stress.
Methods: We surveyed mitochondrial vesicles in rat
and planaria brains with electron microscopy. We
quantified these vesicles with serial-section electron
microscopy (FIB-SEM). We also conducted confocal
microscopy with Airyscan analysis of cultured neurons
expressing
fluorescently
tagged
mitochondrial
markers.
Results: Electron microscopy showed the ultrastructure
of various types of mitochondrial vesicles. Serial-sec-
tion electron microscopy revealed the 3D ultrastructure
of mitochondrial vesicles and their prevalence in neu-
rons. Confocal microscopic analysis showed increased
numbers of mitochondrial vesicles in neurons under
mild stress.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings provide direct
structural evidence for mitochondrial vesicles in neu-
rons and their abundance in response to neuronal
stress. Their detection in the extracellular compartment
(evidence for which is expected to be presented by the
time of ISEV) may allow for development of biomar-
kers for mitochondrial health, with relevance to
numerous pathologic conditions.

Medicine, Philadelphia, USA
Introduction: Chronic pain is the most prevalent,
disabling, and expensive public health condition in
the USA. Exosomes are 30–150 nm extracellular vesi-
cles that can transport RNAs, proteins, and lipid
mediators to recipient cells via circulation. Exosomes
can be beneficial or harmful depending on their
source and contents. We hypothesized that the com-
position of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) can be
altered following nerve injury and these alterations
can provide insight into how the body responds to
neuropathic pain.
Methods: To characterize changes following nerve
injury, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) were purified
by ultracentrifugation from mouse serum four weeks
after spared nerve injury (SNI) or sham surgery.
miRNA profiling and proteomics analysis using tan-
dem mass spectrometry were performed to determine
differential expression of miRNAs and protein cargo
respectively. For in vivo studies, sEVs were admini-
strated intrathecally into the mouse lumbar region.
Animals were evaluated for mechanical and thermal
hypersensitivity over 21 days after injection.
Results: Our miRNA profiling showed a distinct
miRNA signature in SNI model compared to sham
control. Proteomics analysis detected 274 gene pro-
ducts. Of these, 24 were unique to SNI model.
Neuropathic pain can induce the activation of the
complement cascade and we observed significant
upregulation of complement component 5a (C5a) in
sEVs
from
SNI
model.
Intercellular
Adhesion
Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), required for the leukocyte
recruitment, adhesion and homing of exosomes was
also upregulated in sEVs from SNI model compared
to sham control. Administration of sEVs from SNI
model increased paw withdraw threshold in naïve
recipient mice and inflammatory pain model, indicat-
ing a protective role for sEVs in attenuating chronic
pain.
Summary/Conclusion: Our preliminary studies sug-
gest a critical role for sEVs cargo in regulating pain.
Additional studies are ongoing to determine the func-
tional significance of alterations in sEVs composition
using mouse models of pain.

Introduction: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a
progressive
adult-onset
neurodegenerative
disease
caused by selective motor neurons (MNs) death. The
rapid disease progression strongly suggests that cell-to-
cell spreading of noxious factors could take place in
ALS pathogenesis. Extracellular vesicles could poten-
tially spread the disease. In this study, we characterized
large (lEVs) and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) iso-
lated from plasma of sporadic ALS patients and healthy
controls and determined their different composition in
order to understand their neuroprotective or neuro-
toxic role in ALS pathogenesis.
Methods: lEVs and sEVs were isolated from plasma of
40 ALS patients and 30 healthy volunteers by differen-
tial centrifugation and characterized by Nanosight
NS300. CD45, CD31, CD61, CD235a and Annexin V
were used for flow cytometry. SOD1, TDP43, FUS
protein level was investigated by Western Blot. For
Raman Spectroscopy, EVs were dried on top of a
CaF2 slide and Raman spectra were acquired using a
633 nm laser line. miRNA libraries were prepared by
TruSeq Small RNA Library kit (Illumina).
Results: The mean size both for lEVs and for sEVs
resulted increased in ALS patients compared to con-
trols. lEVs derived from ALS patients were enriched in
SOD-1, TDP-43 and FUS proteins compared to
CTRLs. sEVs showed a distinct spectral pattern from
lEVs. In addition, lEVs of ALS patients were richer in
lipids and had less intense bands relative to aromatic
aminoacids compared to healthy controls. We also
found a great presence of leukocyte derived lEVs
(LMVs) in ALS patients compared to AD patients
and healthy donors and significant correlation with
the Progression Rate of the disease. On the other
hand, miRNA and RNA whole transcriptome sequen-
cing identified a specific signature of miRNAs in
plasma derived sEVs of ALS patients compared to a
group of healthy controls and three neurological
groups of control.
Summary/Conclusion: These data may suggest that
lEVs derived from ALS patients, enriched in lipids and
toxic proteins, might play a role in prion-like propaga-
tion and immunity of ALS disease, while sEVs, deriving

Combining high-resolution flow cytometry and surface marker analysis
using an automated platform to study extracellular vesicle in cerebrosp-
inal fluid
Raphael Schneider
Unity Health Toronto, Toronto, Canada
Introduction: There is growing enthusiasm that extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) carry the potential for a variety
of applications in medicine. As biomarkers, EVs may
aid clinicians in the evaluation of diagnoses, disease
progression, or even response to therapy. However,
proper characterization of the amount, size, and phe-
notype of EVs in a given sample remains challenging
due to their sub-micrometre size and heterogeneity.
Over the last years, technologies, including high-sensi-
tivity flow cytometry and automated platforms that
simultaneously assess EV amount, size, and phenotype,
have matured, providing new opportunities to study
EVs for future clinical applications. Using such tech-
nologies to analyse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is
in direct contact with the brain and spinal cord, may
yield valuable insights into neurological disease pro-
cesses. While there is often uncertainty about the exact
source of EVs in a biological sample, CD171 has
emerged as a surface marker that suggests a neuronal
origin.
Methods: CSF samples that had been stored at – 80
degrees Celsius for advanced biomarker studies were
analysed using two distinct approaches. A Becton,
Dickinson and Company (BD) Aria III flow cytometer
was converted into using violet side scatter (SSC) for
improved detection of EVs with 405 instead of 488 nm
SSC. For the combined analysis of amount, size, and
phenotype, samples were analysed with the NanoView
Bio R100 platform. Phenotype analysis included prob-
ing for the classic tetraspanins associated with exo-
somes (CD9, CD63, CD81) and the neural cell
adhesion molecule L1 (CD171).
Results: Flow of CSF samples showed similar vesicle
counts in control vs. disease and an increase of counts
in later disease stages when neurodegeneration is
thought to be more prominent. All CSF samples
showed some binding to classic exosomal markers
(CD9, CD63, CD81). The sample taken at the latest
time point showed relatively high vesicle counts, over-
all larger vesicle size, and abundant CD171 binding.
Interestingly, the CD171 positive EVs were not positive
for any of the classic exosomal markers (CD9, CD63,
and CD81).
Summary/Conclusion: This data supports the notion
that analysing the amount, size, and surface markers of
EVs in CSF can reveal intriguing dynamics in such
basic EV characteristics over time and suggests impor-
tant differences between EV populations in different
disease stages. While previous studies indicated that
CD171 could identify an EV to be of neuronal origin,
it remains to be determined whether such specific sur-
face markers will emerge as clinically relevant tools to
support the evaluation of people affected by neurolo-
gical diseases.

Introduction: Exploring Identifying robust biomarkers is
essential for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.
Blood stream transports large (lEVs) and small extracellu-
lar vesicles (sEVs), which are extracellular vesicles of dif-
ferent sizes and biological functions that are transported in

patients and healthy volunteers (CTR) by ultracentri-
fugation and RNA was extracted. Whole transcriptome
and miRNA libraries were prepared with TruSeq

characterized by a small but specific group of circulat-
ing miRNAs. miRNAs profiling revealed that PD and
FTD can be subgrouped in two classes while AD
appears to be a homogeneous disease population.
Furthermore, miRNAs profiling show the presence of
overlaps in the signatures between the analysed dis-
eases. miRNA profiling in lEVs is similar to that
observed in sEVs, although in lEVs the overall differ-
ences between diseases are less marked.
Summary/Conclusion: In this study we have demon-
strated that miRNAs are the most interesting subpopu-
lation of transcripts transported by plasma derived
sEVs since they discriminate a disease from the other
and they can provide a signature for each neurodegen-
erative diseases.

Introduction: Dendritic spines are actin-rich struc-
tures at the postsynaptic sites of most excitatory
synapses in the central nervous system. They are
highly important structures for higher brain func-
tions such as learning and memory. Several live
imaging studies have shown that long, thin, actin-
rich protrusions called dendritic filopodia are pre-
cursors of dendritic spines in hippocampal and cor-
tical neurons. So far, many intracellular factors that
regulate filopodia formation have been identified.
However, extracellular mechanisms of filopodia for-
mation are largely unknown. Also, detailed molecu-
lar mechanisms by which astrocyte secreted factors
regulate synaptogenesis are not well understood.
Small extracellular vesicles (SEVs)/exosomes have
potential to regulate filopodia, spine and synapse
formation in autocrine or paracrine manner due to
their unique cargo composition. Here, we examine
role of exosomes in filopodia, spine and synapse
formation.
Methods: Primary rat hippocampal and cortical
neurons were transiently transfected with the multi-
vesicular
body
(MVB)
docking
regulator
GFP-
Rab27b or with shRNAs against the exosome secre-
tion and biogenesis regulators Rab27b and Hrs.
Transfected
neurons
were
immunostained
for
synaptic proteins and analysed for filopodia at day
in vitro (DIV) 6 or spines at DIV12. For rescue
experiments, exosomes were isolated using differen-
tial ultracentrifugation method from conditioned
media of DIV9 cortical neurons or primary astro-
cytes and characterized for their size, common pro-
tein markers and morphology.
Results: Here, we find that MVB docking factor GFP-
Rab27b localizes to both the tips and bases of actin-rich
filopodia and spines in primary neurons. Furthermore,
genetic regulation of exosome secretion by overexpres-
sion or knockdown of Rab27b or Hrs leads to respec-
tive increases or decreases in the number of filopodia,
spines and synapses. The defects of exosome-inhibited
neurons in filopodia density are rescued by add-back of
neuronal exosomes. Additionally, treatment of primary
neurons with exosomes isolated from primary astrocyte
cultures
leads
to
enhanced
spine
and
synapse
formation.
Summary/Conclusion:
These
results
indicate
that
autocrine and paracrine communication via exosomes
are a key part of the process of neuronal filopodia,
spine and synapse formation.

may be linked with APOE genotype, we investigated the
possible effect of APOE genotype on brain-derived EVs
(bdEVs) and their protein and RNA molecular cargo.
Methods: Cortical brain tissues of AD patients with dif-
ferent APOE genotypes [ε2/ε3 (n = 5), ε3/ε3 (5), ε3/ε4 (6),
ε4/ε4 (6)] and non-AD controls (n = 7) were obtained.
bdEVs were separated by size exclusion chromatography
plus ultracentrifugation (UC) and characterized per
MISEV2018. Proteins were analysed by mass spectrome-
try. After protein identification, data were normalized
using the Cyclicloess method and analysed by principal
component analysis (PCA). Nested Factorial design high-
lighted differentially expressed proteins. RNA from
bdEVs was extracted by miRNeasy Mini kit. Small RNA
libraries were constructed using the Ion Total RNA-Seq
kit and sequenced on the Ion Torrent S5™using Ion™540
chips. Reads were aligned to human reference transcrip-
tomes using bowtie. Differential gene expression was
quantified by edgeR and limma.
Results: Among 28 proteins dysregulated in AD bd-
sEVs, several have reported roles in AD, e.g., micro-
tubule-associated protein tau and peroxiredoxin-6.
Regarding APOE genotypes, 16 proteins were differen-
tially expressed between ε4 carriers (ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4)
with non ε4 carriers (ε2/ε3 and ε3/ε3). However, EV
markers did not differ by APOE genotype. In contrast
to protein cargo of bdEVs, the overall small RNA
expression pattern was similar among AD patients
with different APOE alleles and non-AD patients.
Only a few miRNAs showed different abundance level
between ε2/ε3 and ε4/ε4 groups, or between AD and
non-AD groups.

proteins
and
miRNAs related to AD development and APOE geno-
types. Further verification of protein and RNA expres-
sion in brain and plasma derived EVs may reveal

Introduction:
Tau-containing
extracellular
vesicles
(EVs) are transmissible and induce tau phosphorylation
and conformational change in the recipient neurons.
However, whether human brain-derived EVs induce
tau pathology has not yet been characterized in the
mouse brain. Here, we assess the mechanisms of disease
spread after intrahippocampal injection of human brain-
derived EVs into the aged mouse model.
Methods: EV-enriched fractions were isolated from
unfixed frozen human brain samples from AD, prodro-
mal AD (pAD), control (CTRL) cases, and tau knockout
(TKO) mouse brains. Isolated EVs containing 300 pg of
human total tau were sterotaxically injected into the
right outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of
18 months-old C57BL/6 female mice. 4.5 months after
the injection, hippocampal slices were prepared for
whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA1 pyramidal
neurons were undertakent. Hippocampi were analysed
with immunohistochemistry using phosphorylated-tau
(p-tau) epitopes including AT8. EVs were examined
for protein composition by protein mass-spectroscopy,
the neuronal uptake in vitro, and structural analysis by
the atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Results: Semiquantitative brain-wide immunohisto-
chemistry of p-tau revealed that inoculation of AD or
pAD-EVs induced tau propagation throughout the hip-
pocampus, including the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1
subregions. AT8 was localized primarily in GAD67
+ GABAergic neurons in pAD and AD EVs groups,
accompanied with reduced amplitude of inhibitory
postsynaptic currents and Excitatory-Inhibitory ratio
in amplitube of postsynaptic currents in CA1 pyrami-
dal neurons in pAD EVs. AFM analysis showed higher
density of tau oligomers in both AD and pAD EVs
while only AD EVs showed significantly higher neuro-
nal uptake compared to CTRL EVs. Finally, proteomic
analysis showed that AD EVs are enriched in disease
and glia-related molecules compared to CTRL EVs,
which may contribute to their enhanced neuronal
uptake.
Summary/Conclusion: Intracranial injection of AD or
pAD EVs induced p-tau accumulation primarily in
GABAergic neurons throughout the hippocampus,
resulted in higher uptake by neurons, and tau oligomer
conformation, indicating of their pathogenic potency
as seeding factors. GABAergic neuronal dysfunction in
the hippocampal neuronal circuitry reported in early
AD brains could be attributed to specific EV mediated
tau propagation in this cell type, a phenomenon merit-
ing further investigation and validation.

Isolation of extracellular vesicles from cerebrospinal fluid and character-
ization of their bioactive compounds to investigate multiple sclerosis
pathogenesis
Ludovic D’auria, Zakia Nasr and Vincent van Pesch
Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels, Belgium
Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most fre-
quent chronic inflammatory disease of the young adult
central nervous system. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis
remains largely unknown. It is therefore relevant to
better characterise in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which
irrigates the brain, novel bioactive compounds whose
dysregulation could be involved in MS pathology. The
concentration of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been
already found affected in MS patient fluids but the
content
in
bioactive
molecules,
particularly
the
microRNAs (miRNAs), remains barely investigated.
The miRNA are short oligonucleotides that are major
posttranscriptional
regulators
and
we
previously
showed the dysregulation of specific miRNAs in CSF
of MS patients. EVs can potentiate miRNA effects by
allowing remote action through the shuttling within
biological fluids such as CSF while providing a protec-
tion
from
circulating
RNAse.
Nevertheless,
CSF
remains a challenging fluid to analyse due to limited
access, low volume and presence of lipoproteins (other
putative miRNA carrier) that can be co-isolated
with EVs.
Methods: We performed a comparative analysis of EV
isolation from CSF by size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC), density-gradient ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltra-
tion or chemical precipitation (ChemP) to determine
the optimal technique(s) to enrich EV.
Results: SEC applied on CSF of control patients
showed optimal EV purification with sufficient EVs
from 0.5 ml of CSF for downstream EV characteriza-
tion. Furthermore, we were able to isolate miRNAs
from CSF and determined their enrichment in EVs by
RNAse-sensitivity treatments. Finally, we have com-
bined ChemP and SEC to enable a fast and large-
scale isolation of EVs from > 5 ml of CSF, which
successfully provided an increase in particles detected
by nanoparticle tracking analysis. We are currently
characterising the particles to confirm that they are
purified EVs, cleared from contaminants.
Summary/Conclusion: This work opens perspective to
analyse EVs from MS patients and to determine
whether miRNAs participates in MS pathogenesis
through their transit in EVs.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released
by cells of the central nervous system as a result of
injury, including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).
Since mTBI may alter circulating levels of EVs, this
study aimed to investigate differences in circulating EV
numbers between contact sport athletes with and with-
out acute mTBI.
Methods: Circulating EVs containing CD63 (CD63
+ EV), CD81 (CD81+ EV), and neural cell adhesion
molecule (L1CAM+EV) were analysed in young, male
athletes with or without mTBI (18–29 yo, n = 6 per
group). Sodium citrate-treated blood samples were
obtained from athletes with mTBI within 48-hours of
injury and from control athletes free of mTBI for one
year. Athletes were best matched for age and history of
prior mTBI. Samples were double-centrifuged to obtain
platelet-poor plasma and stored at −80°C until ana-
lysed. Quantification of EVs was performed using a
spectral flow cytometer. The study was approved by
Temple University’s IRB, and all athletes provided
written informed consent.
Results: Mann-Whitney U tests showed that popula-
tion percentages of small size (179–304 nm) CD63
+ EV, CD81+ EV and L1CAM+EVs were significantly
higher in mTBI athletes (mean rank: 8.0, 9.5, 9.3) than
controls (mean rank: 3.6, 3.5, 3.7) (U = 3.0, p = 0.03;
U = 0.0, p > 0.01; U = 1.0, p > 0.01, respectively).
Population percentages of large size (500–800 nm)
CD63+ EV, CD81+ EV and L1CAM+EVs were also
significantly higher in mTBI athletes (mean rank: 8.2,
9.2, 9.5) than controls (mean rank: 3.4, 3.8, 3.5)
(U = 2.0, p = 0.02; U = 2.0, p > 0.01; U = 0.0,
p > 0.01, respectively). There were no significant differ-
ences between percentages of EVs associated with
blood brain barrier function (CD144+ EV) or platelets
(CD42a+EV) among mTBI athletes or controls.

Introduction: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized
by clinical heterogeneity, different rates of progression
and absence of definitive biomarkers. Extracellular
vesicles (EVs) are easily isolated from plasma and
play a central role in intercellular communication
which is highly relevant for inflammatory processes
implicated in protein misfolding-related neurodegen-
erative disorders. Thus, we characterized distinctive
plasmatic EV subpopulations of PD and atypical par-
kinsonisms (AP) patients, with the aim to identify
candidate biomarkers among EVs surface membrane-
proteins.
Methods: Plasmatic EVs were collected from 27 PD, 19
matched healthy controls (HC), 9 AP with multiple
system atrophy (MSA) and 9 AP with tauopathies
(AP-Tau).
EVs
were
quantified
by
Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis. The expression of 37 EV-surface
markers, related to inflammatory and immune cells,
were measured by MACSPlex and correlated to clinical
scales. A diagnostic model based on EV markers
expression was built via supervised machine learning
algorithms and validated in an external cohort (10 PD,
20 HC, 5 MSA, 5 AP-Tau). The Cantonal Ethics com-
mittee approved the study protocol. All enrolled sub-
jects gave written informed consent.
Results:PDshowedthehighestEVconcentrationcom-

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) are released
from cells to the surroundings and are found in human
biofluids, where they constitute promising targets for
novel biomarker identification. EV have been found in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where they may provide with

Introduction: Arterial thrombosis is a major and glo-
bal cause of human death and disability, but a biomar-
ker for early-diagnosis of thrombosis is absent. Platelet
activation and aggregation are the first steps of platelet-
rich thrombus formation, but their relative contribu-
tion to platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs) release is
unknown.
Methods: To study the relation between PEV release
and platelet interaction (aggregation), citrate-anticoa-
gulated whole blood (WB) from healthy donors was
diluted 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32-fold and activated by 30 μM
thrombin-receptor activating peptide (TRAP). In addi-
tion, undiluted WB and 10-fold diluted WB, which
totally blocked PEV release, were activated with various
TRAP concentrations. Concentrations of PEVs (CD61
+ and CD61+, CD62p + >1000 nm) and activated
platelets (CD61+, CD62p+ >1000 nm) were measured
by flow cytometry (Apogee A60-Micro). Platelet aggre-
gation was assessed using impedance aggregometry.
Results: A 10-fold dilution of WB blocked both aggre-
gation and the release of PEVs. Compared to baseline,
activation of undiluted WB with TRAP increased the
concentrations of CD61 + 2.2-fold and CD61+-CD62p
+
PEVs
7.2-fold.
The
concentration
of
CD61+
(R2 = 0.71) and CD61+-CD62p+ (R2 = 0.78) PEVs as
well as platelet aggregation (R2 = 0.8) scaled inversely
(reciprocal) with the dilution of WB. Further, we found
a linear correlation between the % of activated platelets
and the concentration of CD61+ (R2 = 0.80) and CD61
+, CD62p+ (R2 = 0.64) PEVs in undiluted WB, which
was absent in 10-fold diluted blood (R2 < 0.05).
Summary/Conclusion: The absence of aggregation and
PEV release upon platelet activation in 10-fold diluted
blood shows that aggregation directly depends on the
distance between platelets, which is confirmed by the
reciprocal relationship between PEV release and blood
dilution. Because PEVs are only released when platelet
activation is followed by aggregation, PEVs are a
potential early biomarker of thrombosis.

Introduction: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)
are the most widely used animal model of human
essential hypertension. We previously reported that
plasma small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in SHR reg-
ulate systolic blood pressure, however, the mechanism
has not been clarified. In the present study, we com-
pared the concentration and size distribution of plasma
EVs (sEVs and large EVs) from young and aged nor-
motensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR.
Methods: Heparin-anticoagulated plasma was col-
lected from male WKY and SHR at 5 ~ 7- (young)
and 15- (aged) week-old. Large EVs were isolated
from the plasma by centrifugation (10000 x g). sEVs

were isolated by ultracentrifugation (164,071 x g)
following
precipitation
with
polyethylene-glycol.
The concentration and size distribution of sEVs
and large EVs were measured by a tunable resistive
pulse sensing analysis.
Results: There was no significant difference in the total
concentration of plasma sEVs between WKY and SHR
or between young and aged rats. The mean diameter of
plasma sEVs from aged rats was larger than that from
young rats in both WKY and SHR. Also, the number of
particles with a diameter of smaller than 150 nm in
plasma sEVs from aged rats was lower than that from
young rats. The concentration of plasma large EVs
from aged rats was higher than that from young rats
in both WKY and SHR. There was no significant dif-
ference in the size distribution of plasma large EVs
between WKY and SHR or between young and aged
rats.
Summary/Conclusion: The present results for the first
time demonstrate that the concentration of plasma
large-sized EVs is increased by ageing, while there is
no difference in the concertation and size distribution
of EVs between WKY and SHR. Further research is
required to clarify the cause of age-dependent alterna-
tion in plasma EV size distribution and its physiologi-
cal meaning.

microRNA profiling of circulating extracellular vesicles is involved with
susceptibility to age-related diseases: relevance to cardiovascular signalling
in ageing process

Introduction: Ageing represents a central risk factor
for several diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases.
Our hypothesis is that extracellular vesicles (EVs) can
be potential mechanism of spreading molecules, such
as microRNAs, involved with susceptibility to chronic
age-related diseases and geriatric syndromes. In this
context, the role of microRNAs in age-induced detri-
mental changes in the cardiovascular system has been
suggested. Although EVs can protect microRNAs from
endogenous RNAses and internalization of these vesi-
cles into cells is involved with cell communication,
delivering microRNAs even to distant tissues, the rela-
tionships between EVs microRNAs profile and chronic
age-related diseases has not been evaluated. Our aim
was to investigate the microRNA profile of circulating
EVs during ageing process and their downstream sig-
nalling pathways.
Methods: The Ethics Committee (CEUA – Comissão
de Ética no Uso de Animais – UFRGS; nr. 29,818)
approved all animal procedures and experimental con-
ditions. Male Wistar rats of 3- and 21-month-old were
used, and plasma was obtained from the trunk blood.
EVs were isolated with ExoQuick following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. microRNA was isolated from
EVs and then amplified. microRNA was labelled
using the FlashTag Biotin HSR RNA Labelling Kit
and profiled on Affymetrix GeneChip microRNA 4.0
Arrays. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to
identify pathways regulated by significantly altered
microRNAs.
Results: Microarray analysis revealed 728 microRNAs. Of
these microRNAs, 48 were differentially expressed between
aged and young-adult animals, 18 microRNAs were sig-
nificantly upregulated and 30 were downregulated in aged
animals compared to young adult (p < 0.05; fold change of
|1.1|). A conservative filter was applied on IPA and only
experimentally validated and highly conserved predicted
mRNA targets for each microRNA was used. IPA analysis
showed that cardiac hypertrophic signalling is ranked as
highly predicted targets for these differentially expressed
microRNAs (p < 0.0001). Moreover, IPA demonstrated
that this canonical pathway is upregulated in aged animals
when compared to young adult. In addition to cardiac
hypertrophic signalling, other relevant cardiovascular
canonical pathways, such as endothelin-1 signalling and
intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway have predicted
targets.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results showed for the first
time that microRNAs profile in circulating EVs has a
potential role to drive heart senescence and consequent
cardiac diseases which represents the leading cause of
death.

Introduction: Introduction: The vascular endothelium and
smooth muscle form adjacent cellular layers that comprise
part of the vascular wall. Here, we examined the extent to
which extracellular vesicles (EVs) vesicles participate in
endothelial-vascular smooth muscle cell communication.
Methods: Methods: EVs were collected from rat
aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cell serum-
free media by ultracentrifugation. Vesicle morphol-
ogy, size and concentration were evaluated by trans-
mission
electron
microscopy
and
nanoparticle
tracking
analysis.
Endothelial
cell
and
vascular
smooth muscle cell cultures were subjected to var-
ious
concentrations
of
EVs
for
various
times.
Functional assays were performed.
Results: Results: Western blot as well as shot gun
proteomic analyses revealed sets of proteins common
to both endothelial- and smooth muscle-derived EV as
well as proteins unique to each vascular cell type.
Functionally, endothelial-derived EVs stimulated vas-
cular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression
and enhanced leukocyte adhesion in vascular smooth
muscle cells while smooth muscle EVs did not elicit
similar effects in endothelial cells. EVs from endothelial
cells also induced protein synthesis and senescence-
associated β galactosidase activity in vascular smooth
muscle cells. Proteomic analysis of vascular smooth
muscle cells following exposure to endothelial cell-
derived EVs revealed upregulation of several proteins
including pro-inflammatory molecules, high-mobility
group box (HMGB) 1 and HMGB2. Pharmacological
blockade of HMGB1 and HMGB2 and siRNA deple-
tion of HMGB1 in smooth muscle cells attenuated NF-
kb (p65) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation,
VCAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion induced
by endothelial cell EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Conclusions: These data sug-
gest that endothelial cell-derived EVs can enhance sig-
nalling pathways that induce a pro inflammatory in
vascular smooth muscle cells.

Introduction: Graft patency is one of the major determi-
nants of long-term outcome following coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (CABG). Biomarkers, if indicative
of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, would
suggest strategies to limit graft failure. Many studies have
generated compelling data on the sensitivity of MVs as
biomarkers of cardiovascular disease progression and
events. The MV usefulness in CABG has been tested
only in a study that highlighted their importance in
surgical haemostasis. No information is so far available
on the association between the amount or pattern of
circulating MVs and CABG outcome. We aimed to eval-
uate whether MV pre-operative signature could predict
mid-term graft failure.
Methods: This was a nested case-control substudy of
the CoronAry bypass grafting: factors related to late
events and Graft patency (CAGE) study that enrolled
330 patients undergoing elective CABG. Of these, 179
underwent coronary computed tomography angiogra-
phy 18 months post-surgery showing 24% graft occlu-
sion. Flow cytometry MV analysis was performed in 60
patients (30/group with occluded [cases] and patent
[controls] grafts) on plasma samples collected the day
before surgery and at follow-up.
Results: Before surgery, cases had two-fold (p = 0.020)
and four-fold (p = 0.042) more activated platelet-derived
and TF+ MVs, respectively than controls. The MV
thrombin generation capacity was also significantly
greater (p < 0.05). This MV signature predicted graft
occlusion (AUC of 0.897 [95%CI: 0,77–0,96], p = 0.02).
By using a MV-score (0–6), the OR for re-occlusion for a
score above 3 was 16.3 (95% CI 4.1–65.3, p < 0.001).
Summary/Conclusion: The pre-operative signature of
MVs is an independent predictor of mid-term graft
occlusion in CABG patients and a cumulative MV-
score stratifies patient’s risk. Since the MV signature
mirrors platelet activation, patients with a high MV-
score would benefit from a personalized antiplatelet
therapy.

Introduction: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC)
is characterized by progressive loss of cardiomyocytes
and fibrofatty tissue replacement. Currently, there is no
effective
treatment
for
this
disease.
Exosomes
(imEXOs) secreted by heart stromal cells, engineered
to be immortal and overexpressing β-catenin, exert
anti-inflammatory
and
anti-fibrotic
effects
and
improve ventricular function in models of ischaemic
injury (Ibrahim et al., Nature BME 2019).
Methods: To investigate the effectiveness of imEXOs in
a murine model of AC, four-week old homozygous
DSG2 knockout (DSGKO) mice and wild type (WT,
age-
and
strain-matched)
mice
were
compared.
DSGKO mice were randomized to receive weekly
imEXOs or vehicle via intravenous injection for
4 weeks. Neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM)
proliferation and apoptotic assays were performed to
explore potential effects of exosomes.
Results:
Biodistribution
studies
of
DiR-labelled
imEXOs revealed some cardiac uptake, along with
strong signals in spleen. At 4 weeks, DSGKO mice
which had received intravenous imEXOs showed
improved cardiac function (echocardiographic ejection
fraction 73 ± 2 VS 59 ± 5% in vehicle mice, P = 0.03),
with an underlying attenuation in myocardial fibrosis
by histology. Electrophysiology test showed shorter
QRS duration (4.0 ± 2.0 ms imEXO VS 6.5 ± 2.9 ms
vehicle, P = 0.02) and effective refractory period.
Programmed ventricular stimulation showed DSGKO
mice which had received imEXOs were remarkably less
prone to ventricular tachycardia induction (10.0 ± 32%
VS 55.0 ± 52% in vehicle, P = 0.031). In vitro study
showed NRVM exposed to imEXOs for 2 days exhib-
ited higher BrDU expression relative to vehicle group,
and less Annexin-V expression after oxidative stress
induced by 10-minute illumination with 254 nm UV.
Summary/Conclusion: Intravenous administration of
imEXOs improved cardiac function, reduced cardiac

Introduction: miRNAs regulate the translation of pro-
teins that are involved in redox homoeostasis in the
heart and brain. Intra- and/or inter-organ communica-
tion takes place by multiple mechanisms including
extracellular vesicular (EV) transport. Our previous
studies suggested that cardiac derived miRNA-enriched
EVs contribute to the dysregulation of Nrf2/antioxi-
dant enzyme (ARE) signalling in the myocardium via
intercellular cross-talk, and result in the decreased
Nrf2/ARE signalling in the sympatho-regulatory areas
of the brain in CHF. However, it is unclear if cardiac
derived EVs circulate to the central nervous system
evoking sympatho-excitation by disrupting central
redox homoeostasis.
Methods: Cardiac-specific membrane GFP+ mice were
generated to track the brain distribution of cardiac EVs
in rats with CHF (coronary ligation). The isolation and
characterization of EVs were carried out by differential
ultracentrifugation, TEM, NanoSight, western blotting,
and qRT-PCR. Transfection, labelling, and microinjec-
tion of EVs into the rostral ventrolateral medulla
(RVLM) were performed.
Results: Nrf2 protein was reduced in the RVLM of
CHF rats consistent with an upregulation of Nrf2-tar-
geting miRNAs. Nrf2-targeting miRNAs were enriched
in cardiac and circulating EVs of CHF rats. Nrf2-tar-
geting and cardiac-specific miRNAs were abundant in
brain-derived EVs. Circulating EVs were taken up by
neurons in sympatho-regulatory areas of the brain.
miRNA-enriched EVs from CHF animals increased
sympathetic tone which was prevented by a cocktail
of Nrf2-targeting miRNA inhibitors.
Summary/Conclusion: Myocardial infarction-induced
miRNA-enriched EVs mediate the inter-organ cross-
talk between heart and brain in the oxidative regulation
of sympathetic outflow through targeting the Nrf2/
ARE signalling pathway. These findings suggest that
cardiac-derived EV miRNAs targeting Nrf2/ARE sig-
nalling may act as an endocrine signalling mediator of
CHF that has potential as a novel therapeutic target.

Introduction: A fine-tuned communication between car-
diac cells is vital to maintain myocardial integrity and
contractility. Not only an impairment of gap junction
(GJ)-mediated intercellular communication, but also
defects in EV-mediated communication have been asso-
ciated with ischaemic heart disease,a major causative factor
of heart failure. We have previously shown that Cx43, the
main ventricular GJ protein, assembles into channels at the
EVs surface, mediating the release of vesicle content into
target cells.The main objective of this work was to char-
acterize the signals underlying protein sorting into extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) in a human pathophysiological
context, using connexin43 (Cx43) as a model substrate.
Methods: Animal models of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/
R) injury by ligation of the left anterior descending
coronary artery, ex vivo and in vitro ischaemia models
and human patients were used to investigate the secre-
tion of EV-Cx43.
Results: Release of Cx43 was downregulated in circu-
lating vesicles from I/R-injured mice and patients with
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, as well as
in
intracardiac
and
cardiomyocyte-derived
EVs.
Additionally, we show that ubiquitin signalled the
release of Cx43 in basal conditions but appeared to be
dispensable during ischaemia. Depletion of the autop-
hagy adaptor p62 partially restored the secretion of
Cx43, suggesting an interplay between ischaemia-
induced Cx43 degradation and secretion.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, we demonstrated that
ischaemia impairs the sorting of Cx43 into EVs, which
may ultimately affect long-distance communication.
Through the identification of the underlying molecular
mechanisms and players, these results pave the way
towards the development of innovative diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disorders.

Introduction: Remote ischaemic conditioning is a car-
dioprotective intervention which protects the heart
against ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Transient activa-
tion of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its downstream
regulators (TNFα and IL-6) have been implicated in
cardioprotective interventions. Extracellular vesicles
(EVs) play a role in cardioprotection through the acti-
vation of the TLRs. However, since isolation of EVs in
high amounts with suitable purity from blood is a
challenge, our aim was to develop a cellular model
system from which TLR-inducing, cardioprotective
EVs can be isolated in a reproducible manner.
Methods: EV release from HEK293 cells was induced
by calcium-ionophore A23187. EVs were characterized,
cytoprotection by EVs against simulated ischaemia/
reperfusion injury and its mechanism were investigated
in H9c2 and AC16 cell lines.
Results: A23187 induction of HEK293 cell induced EV
release and the isolates contained mostly large EVs.
EVs decreased cytotoxicity and apoptosis due to 16 h
ischaemia followed by 2 h reperfusion in H9c2 and
AC16 cells in a dose-dependent manner. EVs activated
TLR4 and its downstream signalling pathway in H9c2
and AC16 cells as well as the expression of cytoprotec-
tive haem oxigenase 1 (HO-1) in H9c2 cells.
Summary/Conclusion:
A23187-induced
EVs
exert
cytoprotection in H9c2 and AC16 cells by inducing
TLR4 signalling and HO1 expression. Therefore, EVs
released via calcium-ionophore treatment may serve as
a basis of an efficient carpdioprotective therapy.

Introduction: Biliary strictures may be benign or
malignant. The major malignant causes of biliary stric-
ture are a primary cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) or pan-
creatic
ductal
adenocarcinoma
(PDAC).
There
is
ongoing debate about adequate diagnostics in biliary
strictures
of
unknown
aetiology.
MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs important in
tumourigenesis.
MiRNA
have
been
found
to
be
enriched in exosomes, small membrane-bound extra-
cellular vesicles (EV) of endocytic origin, which is a
novel pathway for intercellular signalling within the
tumour microenvironment and have been implicated
in loco-regional pre-metastatic niche formation. This
project aims to investigate circulating-free and EV
miRNAs as biomarkers that can aid diagnosis in
patients with a biliary stricture. We will (1) isolate
and characterise EVs in plasma and bile from patients
with benign and malignant biliary strictures (i.e. pan-
creaticobiliary cancers); and (2) identify differentially
expressed circulating-free and EV miRNAs in plasma
and bile suitable for detecting malignancy.
Methods: Sample size (n = 126) was calculated for a
study power of 90% and α error of 5% for the ability of
extracellular miRNAs to discriminate benign from
malignant
biliary
strictures.
Prospective
matched
plasma and bile samples will be collected from patients
with benign (n = 63) and malignant (n = 63) biliary
strictures undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangio-
pancreatography (ERCP). EVs will be isolated from the
biofluids by ultracentrifugation and/or size exclusion
chromatography and then characterised (TEM, NTA
and immunoblotting). Circulating-free and EV-asso-
ciated miRNAs will be profiled using small RNA
sequencing. Extracellular miRNA “signatures” will
then be validated by RT-qPCR, and diagnostic accuracy
confirmed (sensitivity, specificity, AUC).
Results: EVs derived from patient samples have been
characterised using NTA, Western blotting and TEM.
SEC derived EVs appear to be more well-defined than
UC EVs with marker positivity for CD63, CD81 and
CD9. Ongoing work will be focused on RNA profiles of
EVs from both malignant and benign cohorts.
Summary/Conclusion: There is currently no effective
method to differentiate benign from malignant biliary
strictures. Novel plasma and bile circulating-free and
EV-associated miRNA biomarkers may improve the
speed and accuracy of diagnosis, resulting in consider-
able patient benefits. Furthermore, as little is known
about the EV-associated function of these tumours,
candidate EV-miRNAs could be taken from “bedside
to bench” and their function further investigated using
in vivo, vitro and silico models.

Next,
long
(>200nt) and short RNAs were isolated from EV
enriched urine of pregnant (n = 5) and non-pregnant
(n = 5) individuals using the mIRCURY kit followed by
the miRNeasy Micro kit. RNA-Seq libraries were pre-
pared using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA
(Oligo(dT) priming) and the SMARTer Stranded Total
RNA-Seq Kit v2 – Pico Input (random priming) meth-
ods (Takara). Preliminary data were obtained using the
Illumina MiSeq, and aligned using STAR v.2.7.3.a.
Results: Overall, RNA isolation using miRCURY fol-
lowed by the SMART-Seq v4 library preparation kit
yielded the highest % of mapped reads: 42% in pooled
non-pregnant, 27% in individual non-pregnant, and
31% in individual pregnant urine. For RNA extracted
using the miRCURY kit, the SMART-Seq v4 libraries
had higher % of mapped mRNA reads compared to
Pico libraries (P < 0.05, t-test). In contrast for
miRNeasy Advanced it was reversed (38% vs 21%).
Summary/Conclusion: Early results from low-depth
sequencing show the highest mRNA mapping rates
for miRCURY followed by the SMART-Seq v4 kit.
High-depth sequencing data are now being generated,
which will enable us to perform detailed comparisons
of different RNA species from the RNA profiles
obtained using
different library
preparations
and
RNA isolation methods from urine of pregnant and
non-pregnant subjects.

mouse model

Introduction: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key con-
tributors to immune homoeostasis. Decreased number
and/or function of these cells are frequent features of
many autoimmune diseases linked to the development
of tissue inflammation. While interleukin-2 (IL-2) is
essential for pan T cell proliferation and performance,
low dose IL-2 treatment has been shown to preferen-
tially affect Tregs and is being evaluated as an inter-
vention in autoimmune diseases. PT101 is a novel IL-2
mutein Fc fusion molecule (IL-2 M) designed to selec-
tively engage with Tregs. Using a humanized NOD-
scid IL2Rn-null (NSG) mouse model we have shown
that PT101 expanded Tregs without significant effects
on other immune cells. We have also shown that Tregs
from PT101-dosed humanized mice exhibit increased
expression of FOXP3 and CD25, and demethylation of
FOXP3 and CTLA-4 genes, suggesting enhanced func-
tion and stability. In the current study we investigated
the miRNA content of plasma exosomes isolated from
PT101- or vehicle-treated mice in order to identify
Treg specific miRNAs from the IL-2 M treated animals.
Methods: CD34+ haematopoietic stem cell humanized
NSG mice were dosed once subcutaneously with PT101
or vehicle. Plasma samples from 8 mice were collected
at Day 7 and exosome isolation was conducted using
the ExoQuick method. Small RNA was extracted and
quantified using the Bioanalyzer Small RNA assay. An
Illumina NextSeq instrument was used for library pre-
paration and sequencing with 75bp single end reads at
an approximate depth of 10–15 million reads per sam-
ple. Raw sequences were mapped to human genome
GRCh37 and analysed via a pipeline provided by the
University of California Santa Cruz.
Results: RNA within the exosomes from vehicle and
IL-2 M-treated groups was mostly comprised of
miRNA and tRNA. Plasma was pooled from 8 animals
per treatment group and differential expression was
determined using a twofold change cut-off. We found
that PT101 treatment actively altered the miRNA con-
tent of plasma exosomes, compared to exosomes from
vehicle-treated
mice.
Many
of
the
differentially
expressed miRNAs are involved in immunoregulation.
Summary/Conclusion: Plasma exosomes from PT101-
treated humanized mice encapsulated treatment-speci-
fic miRNAs which can potentially be used as systemic
biomarkers of Treg expansion and function.

body fluid is of interest. Exosomes are a good resource for
biomarker discovery since they cross the blood-brain bar-
rier easily and contain protein, lipids and nucleic acids
from the cells of origin. The goal of this study was to
look at biomarkers from brain-originating exosomes (spe-
cifically microglia) isolated in the serum of prion-infected
animals.
Methods: Westerns and nanoparticle tracking analysis
(NTA) were used to look at the composition of micro-
glial-specific exosomes. As proof of principle, exosomes
were isolated from a microglial cell line (BV2 cells). A
CD63 antibody was labelled with a fluorophore and
binding
to
exosomes
was
visualized
via
NTA.
Exosomes were isolated from serum of both prion-
infected and mock-infected mice throughout disease
course. A macrophage specific antibody (F4/80) was
bound to beads which were used to isolate exosomes
which includes those of microglial origin. microRNA
was
extracted
from
these
exosomes
and
Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed using
the Illumina platform. CLC Genomics Workbench
was used for bioinformatics analysis.
Results:
Microglial
and
macrophage
proteins
(TMEM119 and Iba1) were identified in exosomes iso-
lated from BV2 cells and prion-infected mouse serum.
Macrophage exosomes were isolated via a novel anti-
body-bead based system. Results of the NGS analysis of
the microRNA isolated from these exosomes indicated
a series of miRNA that could differentiate between
control and infected samples as well as age-specific
markers.
Summary/Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the
first time microglial-specific exosomes have been iso-
lated from prion-infected serum from early and end
stage disease. The results of this analysis could facilitate
the diagnosis of prion disease in easily-accessible bio-
fluids pre-mortem.

Introduction: Urinary Extracellular Vesicles (uEVs)
are emerging as a source for early biomarkers of kidney
damage, holding the potential to replace the conven-
tional invasive techniques including kidney biopsy.
Several methods are available for uEV isolation. Our
aim was to compare different workflows and isolation
by Hydrostatic Filtration Dialysis (HFD), ultracentrifu-
gation (UC) and a kit based isolation method for their
subsequent use in miRNA-seq and RNA-seq for bio-
marker discovery in diabetic kidney disease.
Methods: Type 1 diabetic patients (T1D) with macro-
albuminuria and normoalbuminuric healthy controls
were included in the study. Sample collection and all
experiments were performed in accordance with the
declaration of Helsinki. EVs were isolated from 10–
50 ml of 24 h urine collections by UC, HFD, or a
commercially available kit (Purification based on spin
column chromatography, Urine exosome purification
and RNA isolation Midi kit, Norgen Biotech, Canada)
each with different established urine clarification steps.
Quality control of the EVs was performed with
negative staining EM, NTA and Western blotting.
Isolated RNAs were profiled with Bioanalyzer Pico kit
and subjected to miRNA and mRNA sequencing.
For RNA-seq, cDNA library was prepared using
SMART-seq
v4
Ultra
Low
Input
RNA
Kit
for
Sequencing (Takara Bio, Japan). RNA-seq was per-
formed using HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).
miRNA-seq library was prepared using QIAseq
miRNA Library Kit (Qiagen, Germany). miRNA-seq
was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform
(Illumina).
Results: Our data showed that uEV yield, morphology and
size distribution were closely similar in HFD and UC pre-
parations, while lower yields were obtained using the kit.
By Western blot, EV markers were detectable in
samples isolated by HFD and UC but not readily in
samples isolated with the kit. Tamm-Horsfall Protein
was detected in all the samples and albumin levels
appeared higher in HFD and Kit isolated samples rela-
tive to UC samples.
The number of paired-end reads for RNA-seq in
HFD and UC samples (in both > 5 M) were closely
similar. Instead, RNA reads were lower than 2 M for
the kit samples. For miRNA-seq, the number of reads
as well as the molecular biotype distribution were
similar for the three methods. By principal component
analysis of the RNA-seq data, we observed that HFD
and
UC
grouped
together
showing
similarities.
However, for miRNA-seq data such similarities were
not obvious. This suggests that the three different
workflows and isolation principles may enrich different
miRNA-rich uEV preparation components.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
transcriptomics
data
shows that HFD and UC are suitable methods to isolate

cfDNA distribution in bioliquids: exosome-associated vs. free circulating
form

Introduction: Exosomes contain a variety of biomolecules
including DNA. Knowledge of cfDNA distribution and
localization in bioliquid is important for understanding
both biological function of cfDNA and exosomes. Some
publications state that a large proportion of plasma cfDNA
is localized in exosomes. To quantify cfDNA content in
free vs. exosomal form in human plasma, urine, and saliva,
we employed SubX technology, which allows affinity cap-
ture DNA via phosphates groups of the polynucleotide
chain and exosomes via membrane surface phosphate
moiety clusters. SubX is a proprietary compound that
can simultaneously bind to both cfDNA and exosomes in
bioliquids, thus allowing precipitation of the [SubX-DNA/
SubX-Exosomes] complexes without ultracentrifugation.
Methods: Detection of SubX-DNA and exosomes bind-
ing was done by measurement of particle sizes using
Zetasizer Nano ZS and Nanosight NS300. The samples
were processed with the SubX Exo-DNA isolation kit
following the standard protocols. DNA, protein and
lipid concentrations were measured by fluorescent
assays using Qubit Fluorometer.
Results: SubX efficiently and selectively captures and
co-precipitates cfDNA and exosomes directly from bio-
liquids. Exosomes are easily extracted from the pellet in
exosome reconstitution buffer (ERB), followed by sub-
sequent isolation of tightly bound cfDNA from the
SubX pellet. ERB does not extract DNA form the
[SubX -DNA] pellet and thus does not contaminate
reconstituted exosomes with cfDNA. Thus, we separate
two distinct types of extracellular material – intact
exosomes and purified cfDNA in a single protocol
from the same sample. Over 90% of DNA in plasma
and urine exist as a free circulating pool, while in saliva
up to 30% is associated with exosomes. Thus, cfDNA
distribution is probably bioliquid-specific and must be
evaluated by methods that eliminate cfDNA-outer exo-
somal membrane aggregation.
Summary/Conclusion: SubX technology is suitable for
simultaneous isolation of both cfDNA and exosomes from
the same bioliquid sample. SubX separates cfDNA frag-
ments non-specifically attached to the outer lipid layers of
the exosome membrane from the true intra-exosomal
cfDNA. In contrast, salting-out PEG technique is associated
with aggregation of macromolecules and vesicles and thus
leads to overestimation of exosome-associated polymers
content, including cfDNA.

Tracing extrachromosomal DNA inheritance patterns in glioblastoma
using CRISPR

Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the
most lethal brain tumour; it is characterized by poor
response to standard post-resection radiation and cyto-
toxic therapy, resulting in a dismal prognosis with a
five-year survival rate of 10%. Recurrence after therapy
for GBM is unavoidable. There are substantial differ-
ences among the cells of GBM tumours in the abun-
dance and types of genetic material. This heterogeneity
likely is the major cause of therapy failure, the devel-

rence. A recent study has suggested that the amount of
a particular type of DNA – extrachromosomal DNA
(ecDNA) – differs substantially among different GBM
tumours, and differs within a given GBM tumour over
time. Despite the speculation that ecDNA is a key
factor of tumour heterogeneity, how ecDNA is propa-
gated and distributed among – and how it behaves
within – cancer cells is completely unknown.
Methods: To address this gap in knowledge, this study
focused on developing a novel cytogenetic CRISPR-
based tool that enables visualization and tracking
ecDNA behaviour in live GBM cells.
Results: We found breakpoint sequences resulting
from genome rearrangements during ecDNA forma-

performing

Whole Genome Sequencing data. And each breakpoint
was regarded as a unique target sequence for ecDNA-
specific labelling. The uniqueness of each breakpoint
was
validated
by

(BP-PCR).
Furthermore, the location and the amount of each
breakpoint were observed by breakpoint-FISH (BP-

Introduction: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are
30–150 nm vesicles that mediate intercellular commu-
nication by transferring RNA and proteins to the reci-
pient cells. These cargo molecules are selectively sorted
into sEVs and mirror the physiological state of the
donor cells. Given that sEVs can cross the blood-
brain barrier and their composition can change in
neurological disorders, there is an increasing interest
in elucidating the molecular signatures of sEVs in
circulation as disease biomarkers. However, circulating
sEVs are derived from multiple cellular sources and
determining their source is challenging. Information
on sEV composition can be beneficial in predicting
whether these sEVs are released predominantly from
central nervous system cells. We hypothesized that
differentially expressed miRNAs between neuronal
sEVs and astrocytic sEVs could be used as cell-type-
specific signatures.
Methods: Small extracellular vesicles were isolated from
cell culture media of postnatal mouse primary neurons
and astrocytes using differential centrifugation and char-
acterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmis-
sion electron microscopy and western blotting. RNA
from neurons, astrocytes, and their respective sEVs
were used for transcriptome and small RNA sequencing.
Results: We observed that only a subset of cellular
miRNAs was packaged into sEVs; differential expression
of specific miRNAs between sEVs and their correspond-
ing cells suggest that cells employ special mechanisms to
sort miRNAs into sEVs. These mechanisms could be cell-
type specific since neuronal sEVs showed a different
miRNA
profile
compared
to
astrocytic
sEVs.
EXOmotifs, the short sequence motifs that control the
loading of RNA into sEVs, were present in differentially
expressed miRNAs. We also observed that five RNA-
binding proteins, which are associated with passive or
active RNA sorting into sEVs, were differentially
expressed between neuronal and astrocytic cells.
Summary/Conclusion: miRNA signatures of sEVs
from neurons and astrocytes could be beneficial in
determining if these cell types contribute to the altera-
tions of sEV composition in circulation in neurological
disorders. Cell-type-specific selectivity in RNA loading
might be attributed to the differential expression of
RNA-binding proteins.

Introduction: Analytes present in the extracellular
fraction of bodily fluids (ex. blood, urine) have utility
as a tool for uncovering the molecular landscape of
tumours and hold great potential for discovery of
individualized cancer medicine. Urine, being non-
invasive as a sample type, has an obvious advantage
over blood when used for liquid biopsy purposes.
However, potential for microbial proliferation and
the labile nature of host cells and extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) at the point of sample collection/transport
to the lab drives the need for stabilization of urine
samples. Development of such sample stabilization
opens up capability for the detection of various bio-
markers present in the extracellular fraction to be
used in liquid biopsy. This is of particular concern
as studies around urinary analytes for cancer diag-
nosis, progression and therapeutic effect are rapidly
expanding in cohort sizes. Multi-site collections and
at-clinic collections are increasingly prohibitive for
large scale recruitment and also lead to variability
in the time between collection and processing.
Methods: In this study, we have analysed two commer-
cially available EV extraction kits and compared them
with ultracentrifugation technique for size, concentra-
tion and specificity of the isolated EVs from human
urine samples with and without our proprietary pre-
servation solution using nanoparticle tracking analysis
and western blot analysis for exosomal membrane mar-
kers. EV RNA contents in various urine fractions (first
morning first void, random first void and midstream)
were compared using RT-qPCR assay to provide better
understanding of the collection techniques and fractio-
nations that are ideal for EV research work.

Results: In our current work, we have bench-marked
human urine collection and EV extraction in order to
provide recommendations in standardization of sample
acquisition and processing for urinary EV studies. We
have utilized these standardization in order to develop
a novel and efficient sample stabilization principle for
preservation of EVs and EV RNA in urine samples
during an ambient temperature hold.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together, we have estab-
lished a framework for evaluating technologies and
techniques in the EV sample processing space, which
can be utilized by other research groups.

Introduction: Liquid biopsy is a minimally-invasive diag-
nostic method that detects circulating biomarkers and
has the potential to improve access to molecular profiling
for NSCLC patients when tissue biopsy material is una-
vailable or insufficient. Although isolation of cell-free
DNA (cfDNA) from plasma is the standard liquid biopsy
method for detecting DNA mutations in cancer patients,
the sensitivity can be highly variable. Vn96 is a 27 amino
acid peptide with an affinity for heat shock proteins that
are exposed on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs);
peptide-EV aggregates readily sediment using a benchtop
centrifuge and therefore the Vn96 peptide provides a
rapid, clinically-amenable procedure for EV isolation. In
this study, we determine whether isolation of EVs from
NSCLC patient plasma improves the sensitivity of single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) detection compared to
cfDNA and correlate genetic changes observed by liquid
biopsy with tumour FFPE tissue biopsy.
Methods: Blood was collected from stage III/IV
NSCLC patients with informed consent in either
EDTA or Cell-Free DNA BCT® collection tubes and
plasma was harvested within 30 minutes. Total nucleic
acid (TNA) was extracted from either Vn96-isolated
EVs from EDTA plasma or directly from plasma col-
lected in EDTA or Cell-Free
DNA BCT®
tubes
(cfDNA). SNVs were detected by next-generation
sequencing (NGS)
Results: Vn96 isolation of EVs from plasma resulted in
higher recovery of DNA than cfDNA isolation. The
SNVs detected in both EV-DNA and cfDNA correlated
well with those reported in matched FFPE tumour
tissue using NGS, including 100% specificity for
EGFR mutations. No improvement in SNV detection
was observed using Cell-Free DNA BCT® collection
tubes compared to EDTA tubes. Isolation of EVs with
the Vn96 peptide prior to sequencing improved a
number of NGS parameters including library yield,
total reads, median read coverage and molecular cover-
age, resulting in improved sensitivity of SNV detection.
Summary/Conclusion:
In
summary,
our
research
demonstrates that Vn96-based EV isolation is useful
for molecular profiling of NSCLC patients for whom
tissue biopsy is not an option, thereby improving
access to molecular profiling and targeted therapies.

aAugusta University, Augusta, USA; bVeteran Affairs, San Francisco, USA
Introduction: Prostate cancer (PCa) is fuelled by andro-
gens and androgen receptor (AR) signalling. Therefore,
ablation of AR signalling by Androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) is the goal of first-line therapy that results in cancer
regression initially. However, two to three years post-ADT,
the disease develops into castration-resistant prostate can-
cer (CRPC). As a second-line of therapy, next generation
of AR pathway inhibitors (API) such as Enzalutamide
(ENZ) are used that are effective initially followed by
emergence of drug resistance. A subset of API-resistant
tumours emerges to an AR independent state via under-
going a trans-differentiation to neuroendocrine lineage, a
process referred to as neuroendocrine differentiation
(NED). Due to lack of AR signalling, these PCa variants,
referred to as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), are
impervious to anti-androgen therapy and constitute an
aggressive variant of advanced CRPC with poor prognosis.
Currently, there is a lack of effective molecular biomarkers
for predicting API therapy resistance and emergence of
therapy-induced NED.
Methods: Exosomes/EVs were isolated from sera of a
patient cohort with/without NED. The study was con-
ducted in accordance with ethical guidelines of US
Common Rule and was approved by the institutional
committee on human research. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients. Following exten-

exosomal markers, small RNA sequencing was carried
out on Illumina HiSeq platform to identify differen-
tially expressed transcripts. Machine learning algo-
rithms were applied to clinical sequencing data to
train a “miRNA classifier”. Further, we probed the
proteomic profile of exosomes isolated from NEPC
cellular model NCI-H660 and enzalutamide resistant
CRPC cell lines by mass spectrometry.
Results: We identified that transition from CRPC-
Adenocarcinomas to neuroendocrine states is asso-
ciated with significant EV-miRNA dysregulation, with
a specific dysregulation in certain miRNA families.
With the application of machine learning algorithm,
we identified an EV-based “molecular classifier” that
can robustly stratify CRPC-NE tumours from CRPC-
Adenocarcinomas. Proteomic analyses identified novel
NEPC-specific,
glycosylated
proteins
that
can
be
exploited for NEPC diagnosis.

miRNA and protein profile can predict neuroendocrine
differentiation in advanced castration-resistant prostate
cancer patients.

groups (increasing up to X200 compared to control
samples and decreasing up to no detected expression).
In 6 out of 10 patients with HCC mutant burden was
significant increased compared to mutant burden in

Introduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of can-
cer deaths worldwide and classified primarily as either
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung
cancer (SCLC). Compared to NSCLC, SCLC has a
faster growth rate, earlier widespread metastasis, and
shorter overall survival. The early diagnosis of SCLC
and the development of novel therapeutics have proven
challenging. Thus, progression and recurrence rates
remain high. Non-invasive methods for cancer detec-
tion are increasingly being used to inform clinical
decision making. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have
recently emerged as potential carriers of genetic con-
tents such as microRNAs (miRs) to induce reprogram-
ming of components of the microenvironment in
cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, extracel-
lular miRs expression profiles have been shown to have
signatures related to tumour classification, diagnosis,
and progression.
Methods: We selected a cohort of patients divided
into 4 groups: high-risk smokers, adenocarcinomas,
squamous carcinomas, and SCLC. We extracted total
circulating EV and plasma RNA from plasma (38
patients in total) and RNA from plasma in a separate
group (24 patients in total). Utilizing both next-gen-
eration sequencing (NGS) and nanostring platforms,
we analysed for global microRNA (miRs) expression
patterns. Candidate miRs were then validated by
qRT-PCR.

Results: We identified several deregulated miRs in both
EVs and plasma of SCLC patients compared to the
other groups. For EVs, we validated miR-1285-5p as a
significant biomarker for the late stage of SCLC com-
pared to controls. In the case of plasma, we validated
the upregulation of miR-375 in SCLC compared to
controls.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results indicate that a
potential combination of plasma (miR-375) and
EV-based (miR-1285-5p) miRs be valuable biomar-
kers for SCLC detection and serve as a basis for a
non-invasive SCLC classifier.

Introduction: The isolation of EVs from milk is tech-
nically challenging due to the complexity of milk.
Currently used separation procedures allow for the
removal of milk fat globules and cells (by low speed
centrifugation of fresh milk), removal (by acidifica-
tion), or disruption (by addition of EDTA) of casein
micelles. Using these protocols the integrity, composi-
tion and targeting of bovine milk EVs has been eval-
uated and has led to believe that milk EVs might
withstand these conditions. However, the effects on
functionality of milk EVs (i.e. immunomodulatory
properties) after processing and isolation have not
been studied. Therefore, we have set up an in vitro
culture system using a human T cell line that allows
for the rapid screening of milk EV functionality.
Methods: Fresh bovine milk was defatted and cells
were removed after 2x3,000 g centrifugation, followed
by differential centrifugation at 5,000 g and 10,000 g.
This milk was either subjected to acidification with
HCL, or EDTA was added, or the milk supernatant
remained untouched. Top down Optiprep density gra-
dient separation followed by SEC was used to further
purify EVs. These highly purified milk EVs were added
to human Jurkat T cells, which were simultaneously
stimulated using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.
After 24 h T cell activation was measured by IL-2
cytokine production.
Results: Precipitation or disruption of casein micelles
allowed for the substantial removal of proteins during
isolation compared to directly isolated EVs, which aids
in the purification of milk EVs. In vitro analysis
revealed that in the presence of directly isolated, or
EDTA isolated milk EVs, Jurkat cells were suppressed
in their activation as measured by IL-2 production.
Remarkably, EVs isolated from HCL-acidified milk
were impaired in their suppressive capacity to inhibit
IL-2 production.
Summary/Conclusion: Although casein removal from
bovine milk greatly improves purity of isolated milk
EVs, the detrimental effects on EV functionality should
be considered. Interestingly, EVs exposed to acidic
conditions lost their ability to modulate T cell activa-
tion, which is in contrast with the general believe that
milk EVs could withstand the gastro-intestinal tract.

vesicles from skim milk and infant milk formula

Introduction: Infant milk formula (IMF) is intended to
impart nutrition to infants, similar to breast milk.
However, although industrial IMF production involves
harsh treatment, potential consequences on extracellu-
lar vesicles (EV) in IMF are not yet established. This
study aimed to optimise methods for separating EVs
from IMF and skim milk (SM) and to characterise the
EVs in accordance with MISEV2018.
Methods: SM and IMF were either not treated (NT) or
treated with acetic (AA) or HCl acid (isoelectric pre-
cipitation, IP), to remove caseins. Samples were then
subjected to differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) or
gradient ultracentrifugation using iodixanol solution
(GUC). For DUC, 38 mL samples were centrifuged at
12 K g, 35 K g, 75 K g, 100 K g and 200K g sequentially
for 75 min each and pellets re-suspended in 1 mL PBS.

For bottom-up GUC, increasing iodixanol gradients
with 2.3 mL of samples were centrifuged at 186 K g
for 18 h. Fractions were then pooled based on densities
(1.1–1.2 g/mL). BCA and SDS-PAGE were used to
analyse total protein; nanoparticle tracking (NTA)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for EV
presence; and immunoblotting and imaging flow cyto-
metry (IFCM) to evaluate EV specific markers. (EV-
TRACK ID: EV190096).
Results: Immunoblotting showed absence of Actinin4
from all samples, while CD63 and TSG101 were
detected
for
all
samples;
apart
from
IMF_IP.
NT_samples were not analysed reliably by NTA and
IFCM, due to the high concentration of casein micelles
present (~10^14/mL in milk) that otherwise would be
co-counted with EVs. As expected, following IP, which
most efficiently removed casein micelles, BCA showed
that samples had lowest total protein. This was con-
firmed by SDS-PAGE. Thus, most effects were then
focused on the IP casein-depleted samples. IFCM indi-
cated that, post-GUC, SM_IP EVs had significantly
(P < 0.05) more CD81-positive particles/mL of milk
vs all other GUC and 200 KDUC samples. While there
were no significant differences in sizes of EV separated
from SM or IMF, directly comparing the IP pre-treated
samples, SM had significantly (P < 0.01) higher quan-
tities of EVs when compared to IMF. Additionally,
TEM indicated that EVs separated from SM by GUC
were intact with limited background debris, whereas
those separated from SM by DUC and all IMF EVs
were not.
Summary/Conclusion: In conclusion, regardless of the
method used, IMF has fewer intact EVs compared to
SM. Also, to obtain purest SM EVs, IP followed by
GUC separation is optimal.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exist as subpo-
pulations with heterogeneous content. The surface het-
erogeneity of EVs may reflect differences in functionality
between EV subpopulations, as interactions with recipi-
ent cells may differ between EV subpopulations with
different surface profiles. However, it is currently challen-
ging to study functional differences between EV subpo-
pulations due to the lack of suitable techniques to purify
intact EVs based on their surface signature. Here, we
showcase a novel capture-and-release platform to enrich
intact EV subpopulations by their surface profile and
compare their characteristics.
Methods: MDA-MB-231 and SKOV-3 cell-derived EVs
were isolated using size exclusion chromatography. EV
subpopulations were enriched based on surface markers
CD9, CD63, CD81 or phosphatidylserine (PS) using a
novel magnetic bead-based capture-and-release platform.
Obtained EVs were characterized by transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM), Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
(NTA) and western blotting. EVs were fluorescently
labelled using PKH67 and CellTracker Deep Red
(CTDR) and their uptake by recipient cells was examined
using flow cytometry.
Results: Western blot analysis showed that EV subpo-
pulations enriched for the selected tetraspanins and PS
were successfully isolated using a novel capture-and-
release platform. Interestingly, EVs isolated based on
PS exposure (PS+) lacked most canonical EV markers.
All EV subpopulations showed intact, cup-shaped mor-
phology when analysed by TEM, but contained less
protein contaminants compared to the initial EV iso-
late. PS+ EVs were slightly larger than other EV sub-
populations when analysed by TEM and NTA. To test
the capacity of EV subpopulations to interact with
recipient cells, EVs were labelled with PKH67 and
CTDR prior to subpopulation fractionation. After frac-
tionation, PS+ EVs showed a significantly higher
CTDR/PKH67 ratio than other EV subpopulations as
determined by fluorescence spectroscopy, suggesting
higher esterase activity of PS+ EVs compared to other
tested subpopulations. Furthermore, MDA-MB-231-
derived EVs isolated based on CD9 and CD81 expres-
sion were taken up more efficiently by HMEC-1 and
MDA-MB-231 cells than EVs isolated based on pre-
sence of CD63 or PS.
Summary/Conclusion: Using a novel technology to
isolate EV subpopulations based on their surface pro-
file, we here show that composition and cellular uptake
efficiency
differs
between
EV
subpopulations.
Theoretically, this technology is applicable to any sur-
face marker of interest, allowing its use to further
establish EV surface-functionality relationships and
enrich EVs with desirable characteristics for therapeu-
tic purposes.

Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Taiwan (Republic of
China)
Introduction: Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
is becoming a widely used technique for separating
of extracellular vesicles. Various commercially avail-
able products were launched on the market, how-
ever, their separation efficiencies were not fully
disclosed.
Herein,
novel
porous
agarose
micro-
spheres with the tunable diameter and pore size
were synthesized by emulsion reaction. The perfor-
mance was evaluated and compared with commer-
cial products. The modified SEC column packing
materials were shown to exhibit advantages for
rapid, high-recovery and high-purity separation of
extracellular vesicles from cell culture-conditioned
medium and human plasma.
Methods: The homemade SEC column was packed by
gravity flow. 100 μL of the sample was loaded and the
PBS buffer was used as eluent. 24 factions were col-
lected and analysed by CD9/CD9 sandwich ELISA
assay and by micro BCA assay for determining respec-
tively extracellular vesicles and total protein content.
Results: Agarose microspheres were prepared by emul-
sification. The particle size can be controlled by the
types and concentrations of surfactants. The product
was collected by desired screen meshes and used as
packing materials of the SEC column. Our results
showed that the extracellular vesicles were clearly sepa-
rated from proteins. More than 99.8% of proteins were
removed while the recovery of extracellular vesicles was
close to 70%, which is much higher than 32% of the
commercial product. The total separation time was less
than 15 min.
Summary/Conclusion:
We
have
established
an
approach for generating spherical agarose micro-
spheres as packing materials of homemade SEC col-
umns, which are capable of separating extracellular
vesicles from complex samples with high efficiency.
Further validations with additional samples are cur-
rently ongoing.

Introduction: EVs derived from tumour cells have the
potential to provide a much-needed source of non-inva-
sive molecular biomarkers for liquid biopsies. However,
compromises have to be made when using a particular
technology/methodology
for
the
isolation
of
EVs.
Currently, there is a trade-off between sample volume
and specificity in EV isolation technologies that limits
quantitative molecular analysis of EV contents, ultimately
impacting the utility of EVs in cancer diagnostics. Here,
we present an approach called immunomagnetic sequen-
tial ultrafiltration (iSUF). Our platform combines ultra-
filtration and immunoaffinity separation. Using iSUF, we
demonstrate that small or large volumes of biofluid can
be processed (~ 100 µL or > 100 mL) while concomitantly
removing 99.9 % contaminating proteins. We also pro-
cessed serum from breast cancer patients enabling the
characterization of different tumour and immune bio-
markers on the isolated EVs.
Methods: Human samples were collected under an
approved IRB. Size distribution and concentration of
EVs were measured using a tunable resistive pulse
sensing (TRPS) method. EV proteins and RNAs were
extracted and quantified using a BCA protein assay and
UV spectroscopy. iSUF and other EV isolation meth-
ods were compared for EV concentration, protein, and
RNA quantity.
Results: 50 mL of cell culture media (CCM), 0.5 mL
serum, and 100 mL urine samples were processed with
the iSUF platform and recovered in 100 µL. For all
cases, EVs were enriched with recovery efficiency
greater than 95%. The processing time for a 100 mL
sample was 120 min with over 99% of purity. We
compared EV concentration and purity isolate from
0.5 mL serum using iSUF and other commercially
available methods, iSUF demonstrated superior perfor-
mance on isolating EVs at high concentrations and
purities. Analysis of total RNA amounts in the isolated
EVs using different methods was corresponding to
higher EV recovery efficiency of iSUF. We also com-
pared protein and RNA levels of EVs enriched with
iSUF present in urine and serum samples from the
same donors (n = 10), and we found that for the
same number of EVs, the EV RNA concentration
from both biofluids showed no significant difference.
Finally,
we
have
processed
serum
samples
from
10 metastatic breast cancer patients and demonstrated
that their isolated EVs have expression levels of HER2,
CD24 and miR21 biomarkers at significantly higher
levels than healthy controls.

scale-down or -up to work with small or large volumes

our platform to be used for cancer diagnosis or mon-
itoring treatment response.

Introduction:
Multiple
myeloma
(MM)
remains
incurable despite advances in its treatment and
research progress on the crosstalk between MM and
surrounding host cells. Exosomes are important reg-
ulators of the cellular niche. Their importance for
diagnostic and therapeutic applications has been pro-
ven in many cancers. In this context we hypothesized
that a better understanding of the molecular role and
features of MM-derived exosomes would provide a
basis for their use for both risk stratification and as
predictive biomarkers of response to anti-MM drugs
already in use in clinical settings, given the optimiza-
tion
and
validity
of
their
isolation/purification
method.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from human MM
cell lines (HMCLs) supernatants and peripheral blood
plasma (PBPL) isolated from healthy donors, MM and
MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance) patients. Both fresh and frozen samples
were tested. We evaluated 3 commercially-available
kits, density-based separation and ultracentrifugation.
Results: Higher purity and recovery, evaluated by wes-
tern blotting, nanoparticle tracking analysis and elec-
tron
microscopy,
were
observed
for
supernatant
density-based purification and for PBPL resin-based
isolation.
Exploring the function of MM-derived exosomes,
we observed an increase in proliferation of the immor-
talized stromal cell (SC) line HS5 treated with exo-
somes when compared to untreated cells, and a
higher increase in proliferation of SCs treated with
MM-exosomes when compared to exosomes derived
from normal and MGUS PBPL samples.
Summary/Conclusion: The method of isolation repre-
sents a critical step in the study of exosomes as many
factors can affect the purity, yield and downstream
application. Our data demonstrated that density and
resin-based isolation methods provided functional
MM-derived exosomes with proliferative effects on
SCs. Altogether our findings may serve as a guide to
choose exosome isolation methods for MM studies.
Further optimization steps, including albumin-deple-
tion from plasma samples and use/type of serum in
cell cultures, should be taken into consideration when
planning proteomics and genomics as downstream
applications.

Introduction: In order to determine and validate the
tissue-specific content of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in
biofluids, robust EV isolation methods from tissues
must be developed. However, to date very few rigorous
methods to isolate or enrich for intact EVs from tissues
have been reported. We present a comprehensive exo-
some isolation method with a sufficient level of char-
acterization to unequivocally demonstrate true EV
identity from ex vivo eyes.
Methods: Iodixanol (OptiPrep) buoyant density gradi-
ent ultracentrifugation (DGUC), cushioned DGUC (C-
DGUC), and our newly developed C-DGUC immuno-
capture (C-DGUC-IP) method were used to compare
yield and enrichment of exosomes isolated from por-
cine eyes between 3 to 5 hours post-mortem. Yield was
assessed by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and
immunoblotting for exosomal markers along with total
protein quantitation. Enrichment was assessed by com-
parison of exosomal markers, ocular-specific markers
and known contaminant markers, plus in-depth pro-
teomic mass spectrometry analyses.
Results: High enrichment of posterior eyecup small
EVs (sEV) were achieved by DGUC and C-DGUC,
with C-DGUC resulting in an eightfold increase in
yield by NTA and two to fivefold increases of exosomal
protein markers such as Syntenin-1 and CD81 by
immuno-blotting compared to DGUC. Interestingly,

in-depth proteomic analyses revealed that a majority of
these sEVs with densities of 1.07–1.11 g/ml isolated by
DGUC and C-DGUC were likely of endoplasmic reti-
culum (ER) and Golgi origin, suggesting ER-to-Golgi
transport vesicles resulting from post-mortem tissue
cell rupture. In order to enrich further for sEVs
(including exosomes) we subjected sEVs isolated by
C-DGUC to anti-CD81 immunocapture. The resulting
sEV proteome was enriched 1.5- to 4-fold for bona fide
sEV and exosome markers compared to C-DGUC.
Summary/Conclusion: The C-DGUC method provides
an enhanced yield and purity of sEVs and exosomes from
ex vivo eye tissue. However, to avoid significant contam-
ination with ER and Golgi-derived vesicles from post-
mortem eyes, a final EV-specific immunocapture step is
required to achieve sufficient purity for subsequent ana-
lyses. Our highly rigorous method paves the way for
identification and validation of ocular-derived exosomes
in blood and their potential use as eye disease biomarkers.

Introduction: Personalized treatment for cancer is a
promising way to face the multiplicity of the disease, to
increase the efficacy of drugs and to decrease their
toxicity. As part of this strategy, liquid biopsy explores
a new non-invasive approach to diagnose cancer, guide
treatment and monitor its efficacy. Extracellular vesi-
cles (EVs) are nanometric lipid bilayers micelles with
high potential as biomarkers. They are involved in the
transfer of information (proteins, RNA and DNA)
between cells. EVs include a broad spectrum of particle
sizes, from the tens to thousands of nanometres.
The isolation of EVs from complex matrices is the
first step of any protocol and is particularly important
for the reproducibility and fidelity of the results pre-
sented, as it could bring bias in further analysis. In
order to explore the heterogeneity of EVs, a full char-
acterization (physical and biological) of the extracted
EVs is needed. We evaluate and compare 3 EVs pur-
ification methods, including ultracentrifugation, size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC) column and an emer-
ging microfluidic technology: LabSpinner filtration lab-
on-a-disc device isolating EVs between two filters of
600 and 20nm.
Methods: A431 cell supernatant was used as a model
matrix. We compared three methods of extraction of
EVs: ultracentrifugation with two cycles of 1 h10 at
110,000 g at 4 degrees Celsius (rotor type 70Ti,
Beckman Floor Ultracentrifuge Optima L90 K), qEV
size exclusion chromatography columns from Izon
(qEVoriginal/70 nm) and lab-on-a-disc filtration sys-
tem (LabSpinner, Exodisc C). EVs characterization
was conducted with NTA (NanoSightNS500), TRPS
(Izon), nanodrop (spectrometerND1000), TEM (FEI
Tecnai 12 120 kV) and custom micro- immuno-assay.
Results: In this study, we characterize a filtration sys-
tem made of two serial filters of 600 nm and 20 nm
pores for isolation of EVs. Compared to ultracentrifu-
gation and chromatography columns, yield of extrac-
tion is up to 10 times higher and the size of the
extracted particles is smaller. TEM imaging was used
for assessment of the quality of the extracted EVs.
However, albumin concentration measurement tends
to show that the purity of the solution is decreased.
The immuno-labelling analysis shows that the proteo-
mic signature of the extracted EVs differs according to
the extraction methods. The new filtration technology
seems to give us access to a broader range of EVs
compared to standard methods.
Summary/Conclusion: In this study, we characterized
3 purification methods including lab-on-a-disc filtra-
tion, and were able to demonstrate an increase of the
concentration of EVs by a factor of 10, a decrease of
the size of the accessible extracted particles and access
to new proteomic signatures.

Introduction: The isolation of extracellular vesicles (EV)
from body fluids is still controversial and the poor under-
standing of vesicle stability and effects of sample proces-
sing is probably one of the core issues preventing the
breakthrough of this field into applicative practices.
Methods: We performed an in-depth study of sample
changes in blood, blood plasma and samples throughout
the increasing speed of centrifugation, considering the
number, size, contents and shape of particles in the isolates.
Flow cytometry, light scattering, mass spectrometry and
scanning electron microscopy were employed to reveal the
properties of material in the samples.
Results: The particles of size about 100–500 nm
with characteristic topology of membrane vesicles
without internal structure were observed by the
scanning electron microscope only in EV isolates
prepared from fresh blood sample. Inspection of
the tube surface in which the isolation took place
suggests that those particles are likely formed from
activated platelets tearing at the tube wall due to the
centrifugal pull.
The isolates prepared from frozen blood plasma
prepared by centrifugation with different forces con-
tained different amounts of particles with similar
protein contents, predominated by highly abundant
human plasma proteins, including albumins and
immunoglobulins. Some lipoprotein clearance and
fibronectin
precipitation
were
however
observed
through increased speed and time of centrifugation.
Summary/Conclusion: The results of this study [1] con-
tribute to the understanding of stability and dynamics of
membrane particles. The reported evidence provides the
support for viewing EV isolates as a product, shaped by
uniqueness of the starting samples and the thermal and
mechanical stress applied upon processing. We believe
this kind of insights strengthen our ability of reading the
story of EVs.

Introduction: Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell
death with diverse roles in the tumour microenviron-
ment and emerging data show that, besides its role in
tumour suppression, it can also promote oncogenic
proliferation.
Highly
aggressive
tumours
such
as
Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) show high levels of apoptosis,
which has a diagnostic and prognostic value for classi-
fying and staging the disease. We hypothesize that
amongst other elements, extracellular vesicles (EV)
are key mediators of apoptotic cell-derived tumour
microenvironment signals. Here, we report on EV
released in vitro by apoptotic BL cells (Apo-EV) in
relation to their potential use as cancer biomarkers.
Methods: Basic physical properties of Apo-EV such as
structure, size distribution, surface charge and mem-
brane fluidity are discussed using Cryo Electron
Microscopy
(EM)
and
Tomography,
Nanoparticle
Tracking Analysis, Dynamic Light Scattering and fluor-
escence anisotropy respectively. For phenotypic analy-
sis we apply immunocapture and flow cytometry,
immunogold labelling on transmission EM, fluores-
cence microscopy and quantitative PCR. In addition,
we study the interaction of Apo-EV with blood com-
ponents such as platelets, leucocytes and red cells, in
order to understand their effects in the circulation and
therefore their potential for analysis in blood samples.
Results: Looking at the differences between Apo- and
non-Apo-EV, Apo-EV have larger diameter, while
structurally are not different. However, we have iden-
tified distinct Apo-EV markers such as active caspase 3
and histones, or DNA and small non-coding RNA-Y.
There is also strong interaction of EV with platelets
and leucocytes but not with red cells, indicating poten-
tial routes of transfer of EV cargo in the circulation.
Summary/Conclusion: It is concluded that for the
characterization of the heterogenous EV populations,
combination of multiple techniques is often required,
and also, understanding the strengths and limitations
of each method is essential for choosing the appropri-
ate set of analytical tools. Finally, we consider that
monitoring free circulating Apo-EV or blood cells
with which they have interacted is a promising
approach to improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis and
evaluation of therapeutic response.

Introduction:
Pancreatic
Ductal
Adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) is a devastating disease driven and supported
by changes in its microenvironment, or stroma. Here
we dissect the intercellular communication that exists
between the primary stromal component, cancer-asso-
ciated fibroblasts (CAFs) and PDAC. PDAC commu-
nicates with its microenvironment, in part, through the
exchange of specific types of extracellular vesicles
(EVs). Specifically, we focus on the mechanism by
which CAF-secreted EVs support PDAC survival,
with an additional goal to identify biomarkers suitable
to generate a future “liquid biopsy” test for early PDAC
detection and prognosis.

and non-functional mutant proteins are used to block
EV interaction with target cells.
Results: We observe sub-types of CAF-EVs containing
unique surface receptors. One EV sub-population of
interest
contains
a
novel
surface
protein
(NSP)
expressed on the plasma membrane of pancreatic
CAFs, but not their healthy counterparts. Further,
PDAC cells up-regulate NSP’s lone binding partner,
suggesting a role for these factors in PDAC-selective
EV uptake. Functional assays designed to test PDAC
viability suggest these NSP(+)-EVs protect PDAC cells
from programmed cell death as a result of physiological
stress. This EV-mediated survival benefit can also be
inhibited by blocking the interaction of NSP and its
binding partner, suggesting the engagement of these
two factors is necessary for CAFs to support PDAC
via EVs. Pursuing our biomarker goal we confirm
stromal NSP expression increases during early PanIn
stages prior to tumour development, and we are cur-
rently seeking to validate NSP(+)-EVs in blood of
PDAC patients.
Summary/Conclusion: This research shines light on a
novel mechanism of tumour-stroma communication
that may be crucial for cancer progression during
early disease stages and a potential target for disrupting
the supportive role of the tumour microenvironment.
Additionally, we describe a sub-population of NSP
(+)-EVs that have the potential to serve as biomarkers
for identifying PDAC development.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an
ideal source of functional biomarkers due to their role
in intercellular communication and their ability to
protect cargo, including RNA, from degradation. The
most investigated EV’s are exosomes, nanovesicles
secreted by all cell types and able to cross the blood-
brain-barrier. Here we characterised the RNA of exo-
somes isolated from medulloblastoma cell lines, with
the aim of investigating exosomal RNA cargo as poten-
tial functional biomarkers for medulloblastoma.
Methods: Exosomes derived from a panel of matched
(original tumour and metastasis) medulloblastoma cell
lines were isolated and characterised by NanoSight,
electron microscopy, western blotting and Nanoscale
flow cytometry. Exosomal miRNA and mRNA from
our matched cell lines and foetal neuronal stem cells,
which were used as a normal control, were analysed by
RNA-sequencing technology.
Results: Based on hierarchical clustering, malignant
derived exosomes were distinctly separated from nor-
mal control exosomes. miRNA profiling revealed sev-
eral established oncomiRs identified in our malignant
derived exosomes compared to control samples. Using
interaction pathway analysis, we identified that our
malignant exosomes carry numerous miRNAs impli-
cated in migration, proliferation, cellular adhesion and
tumour growth. Several previously identified oncomiRs
were also identified to be present at higher levels in
metastatic exosomes compared to primary and normal,
including hsa-miR-455-3p and hsa-miR-92a-3p.
Summary/Conclusion: This study shows that exo-
somes from MB cells carry a distinct miRNA cargo
which could enhance medulloblastoma progression.
The use of circulating exosomes as markers of meta-
static disease could be an innovative and powerful non-
invasive tool.

Introduction: Inflammatory changes in the bone mar-

progenitor cell (HSPC) function during acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) significantly contribute to patient
morbidity and mortality. Our laboratory has previously
shown that AML-derived extracellular vesicle (EV-
AML) trafficking confers a state of enforced quiescence
and leads to lasting DNA damage in HSPCs. Here we
explore the underlying cause. Specifically, we hypothe-
size that EV-AML incite inflammatory regulators as
potential mediators of DNA damage.
Methods: As a validated model of AML, we utilized the

AML were harvested from TiB49 cells cultured in EV-
free medium using serial ultracentrifugation. HSPC
(KSL; Lin-Sca1+ cKit+) clonogenicity and inflamma-
tory responses were assessed using colony-forming unit
(CFU) assay and real-time polymerase-chain reaction,
respectively. IFN-alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1) expres-
sion and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
levels were assessed by flow cytometry. DNA damage
were assessed by quantifying nuclear γ-h2ax using
immunofluorescent microscopy.
Results: Similar to EVs derived from AML patients,
TiB49 EV-AML elicited double-stranded breaks in
HSPCs, and actively suppressed HSPC clonogenicity.
Transcriptional profiling revealed that exposure to EV-
AML induced the upregulation of several inflammatory
mediators in HSPCs, including ISG15, IL-6, IFNα,
CH25 H. Inflammatory signalling triggered by EV-
AML did not depend on IFNα signalling as evident
from suppression of clonogenicity in IFNAR1-null
HSPCs as well as the lack of EVs-induced STAT1
phosphorylation or IFNAR1 downregulation. Instead,
we found increased levels of ROS following EV-AML
exposure.
Summary/Conclusion: Our findings support a model
whereby EV-AML inflammatory signalling and oxida-
tive stress lead to DNA damage in HSPCs.

BATF2 crosstalk with distant tissues. AMD3100 block-
ing in tumour model confirms that EVs-BATF2 domi-
nated by the SDF-1a/CXCR4 signalling pathway. In
addition, Exo-counter detection of EVs in 32 pairs of
gliomas in different stages proposes plasma-EVsBATF2
(plEVs-BATF2) as a prognostic marker.
Results: We found that tumour-derived EVs-BATF2 reg-
ulate crosstalk between glioma cells and tumour micro-
environment by inhibiting MDSCs recruitment. EVs-
BATF2 can be detected in plasma and bone marrow of
glioma-bearing mice, this provides direct evidence that
glioma-derived EVs can communicate with distant site by
crossing blood-brain barrier. Besides, EVs-BATF2 injec-
tion significantly reduced SDF-1α expression in the
tumour tissues. After blocking SDF-1α signalling by
AMD3100, the inhibitory effects of BATF2 overexpres-
sion on MDSCs recruitment were rescued. EVs-BATF2
inhibit MDSCs recruiting and secreting MMP2, MMP9,
and
VEGFA
which
promote
GBM
progression.
Strikingly, Exo-counter detection of EVs in 32 pairs of
gliomas in different stages reveals that the number of
plEVs-BATF2 can distinguish stage III–IV glioma from
stage I–II glioma and healthy donors.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results suggest that EVs-
BATF2 may be an effective circulating biomarker asso-
ciated with glioma progression. Of note, we are the first
to determine the regulatory role of EVs-BATF2 in
regulating tumour microenvironment and propose
plEVs-BATF2
as
a
prognostic
marker
predicting
glioma progression and candidate target for GBM
therapy.

Previous work has indicated that miRNAs, notably
miR-146a and miR-155, play a critical role in SCC
tumour development. EVs are membrane-bound vesi-
cles involved in cell-cell communication carrying
actively sorted cargo, protected from degradation. The
potential pathways these vesicular miRNAs modulate
and the implication they have on cancer biology is
under active investigation. We have previously shown
that the cadherin Dsg2, a stem cell marker, modulates
EV release. Dsg2 is upregulated in a number of cancers,
including SCC, and correlates with poor prognosis.
Here we aim to elucidate the impact of EV-associated
miRNAs in SCCs by bioinformatic analysis.
Methods: SCC cells stably expressing Dsg2 were gen-
erated and EVs isolated by sequential ultracentrifuga-
tion. Total cellular and EV RNA was isolated by
miRNeasy, analysed using RNAseq and identified by
GRCh37 alignment. Results were confirmed by qPCR.
Altered pathways based on targets were identified using
miRNet and KEGG pathway analysis. Potential cancer-
associated cytokine targets were confirmed by antibody
array.
Results: RNAseq revealed 87 cellular and 15 EV
miRNAs that were differentially expressed in response
to Dsg2 with 7 overlapping. The highest altered
miRNAs were validated by qPCR. KEGG pathway ana-
lysis determined that these miRNAs have the highest
number of shared targets in Cancer, Cell Cycle, and
p53 Signalling pathways. Interestingly, miR-155 was
upregulated while miR-146a was dramatically down-
regulated in EVs. Targets of miR-146a, ICAM-1, IL-6,
and IL-8, cytokines critical for cancer progression were
upregulated.
Summary/Conclusion: These results suggest that the
miRNA content of EVs is tightly regulated. By altering
the miRNA profile, Dsg2 contributes to the pathogeni-
city of these EVs by increasing levels of cytokines
important for cancer stem cell renewal and metastasis.
In addition, these miRNAs may serve as non-invasive
diagnostic markers for SCCs.

Cancer cells grown in 3D release distinct extracellular vesicles during
tumour growth and invasion

Introduction: Cancer cells secrete extracellular vesicles
(EVs) that affect tumour progression. The characteristics
of EVs produced during tumour growth and invasion are
however poorly understood. In this study, we identify the
composition and characteristics of EVs produced by non-
invasive and invasive tumours and correlate these charac-
teristics with the invasive status of the tumour. For that
purpose, we established a protocol for isolating EVs from
extracellular matrix (ECM)-based three-dimensional (3D)
cancer cell cultures.
Methods: Human prostate cancer PC3 cells were
grown in 3D cultures using ECM-based hydrogel, in
standard 2D culture conditions and in bioreactor. EVs
were isolated from these cultures with differential and
density gradient centrifugation. The isolated EVs were
characterized with nanoparticle tracking analyses, elec-
tron microscopy, immunoblotting and mass spectro-
metry (MS).
Results: Our results demonstrate that 3D ECM-based
hydrogel cell cultures secrete EVs that can be isolated
from both the conditioned media and the hydrogel.
The invasive 3D cultivated PC3 organoids were
found to secrete large amounts of EVs compared to
the non-invasive organoids. Interestingly, our MS
results revealed that non-invasive and invasive orga-
noids secrete EVs with partially distinct protein
cargo.
Summary/Conclusion: We have established a novel
protocol for EV production in a 3D cell culture system
utilizing
ECM-based
hydrogel,
in
which
invasive
tumour growth can be mimicked. Our method allows
the specific isolation and characterization of EVs
derived from different stages of 3D culture, such as
non-invasive and invasive organoids. Importantly, we
found that tumour-derived EVs change in composition
during the tumour progression. Taken together, our
method can be used to define the distinct EV charac-
teristics involved in cancer invasion.

We previously showed extracellular vesicles (EVs) to be
causally involved in transmitting drug resistance. This
study aimed to evaluate compounds proposed to
reduce/block EV release. Specifically, we selected cal-
peptin and Y2763 (proposed to inhibit EVs budding
from the cell membrane) and manumycin A and
GW4869 (proposed to inhibit EVs deriving from
MVBs). Associated effects on -and consequences of-
EV release were then investigated.
Methods: Suitable compounds concentrations that
were non-toxic to cells were first selected by perform-
ing
cytotoxicity
assay
and
flow
cytometry
(FC).
Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from doce-
taxel-resistant PC3 (PC3 RD) cells after 48 h incuba-
tion
in
dFBS-medium
with
or
without
the
4
compounds. EVs were separated from tangential flow
filtration concentrated CM using Optiprep density gra-
dient. 1.03–1.16 g/mL fractions were then pooled and
washed. EVs were characterised using NTA, immuno-
blot, TEM and lipid assay and FC. Influences on
growth and migration, of EVs continuing to be released
(at 1x105EVs/3x103cells, 1x107EVs/3x103cells), were
evaluated on recipient DU145 and 22Rv1 cells.
EVTRACK ID EV190113, score 88%
Results: Calpeptin and Y27632, alone and in combination,
did not significantly affect quantities of EVs released.
However, GW4869 significantly (p < 0.004) increased
quantities of released EVs, of a larger size; very high
protein to lipid ratio; and carrying GRP94 compared to
control EVs (p < 0.006). This effect was reverted when
GW4869 was combined with manumycin A (p < 0.004).
Following all compounds treatments, 1x105EVs/
3x103cells
inhibited
22
RV1
proliferation
(p < 0.0014), while at 1x107EVs/3x103cells only EVs
from
manumycin
A
(p
<
0.05)
and
Y27632
(p < 0.00036) treated cells reduce 22 RV1 proliferation.
EVs
following
GW4869
treatment
significantly
(p < 0.001) inhibited DU145 migration compared to
bulk non-treated control and compared to the effect
obtained using the entire pool of EVs (p < 0.001).
Summary/Conclusion: While none of the 4 proposed
inhibitors significantly reduced EV release, the result-
ing EVs were less potent in transmitting aggressive
behaviour, such as proliferation and migration, to
receiving cell lines.

Introduction: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the lead-
ing cause of cancer-related death with a low 5-year survi-
val. Although the importance of intra-tumoral cellular
heterogeneity of solid tumors in the clinical outcome
and treatment is emerging, proper models to study its
effects on EV release and cargo in human tissues still lack.
The 3D organoid technology maintains the cellular and
genetic heterogeneity of in vivo tissues and has proved to
be so far the best ex vivo model of human cancers. By
using patient-derived and mouse organoids we set out i)
to compare the EV release from normal and tumor tissues
and ii) to follow changes in EV secretion when the rela-
tive ratio of tumor cell subpopulations is shifted.
Methods: We used mouse and LUAD patient-derived
normal and tumor organoids. The Medical Research
Council of Hungary approved our experiments with
human samples and informed consent was obtained
from patients. EVs were detected by antibody-coated
beads, NTA and TEM. Intra-organoid heterogeneity
was proved by immunostaining and RT-qPCR.
Results: We provide evidence that both mouse and
human normal organoids contain all the bronchiolar
cell types. Interestingly, LUAD organoids selected for
TP53 mutation contained not only Ki67+ proliferating
cells, but differentiated cell types as well. Furthermore,
all the lung organoid cultures produced EVs and this
was shifted to the smaller size range. Interestingly
however, when modifying the proportion of organoid
cell types, we observed an increased EV release when
more Ki67+ proliferating cells were present both in
normal and in LUAD samples.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data show that patient-
derived lung organoids represent a novel model to
study the role of intra-tissue heterogeneity in EV func-
tions in the humans, leading to improved diagnosis.

Introduction: By incompletely understood mechan-
isms, MI patients sustain systemic metabolic disor-
der. Adipocytes are an important cellular type
regulating energy homoeostasis. The impact of MI
upon
adipocyte
function
remains
unknown.
Exosomes
(Exo)
are
critical
vehicles
mediating
organ-organ
communication.
However,
whether
and how Exo may mediate post-MI cardiomyocyte/
adipocyte communication have not been previously
investigated.
Methods: Adult male mice were subjected to MI/R.
Serum Exo were isolated 3 hours after R and incubated
with 3T3 L cells for 24 hours. The effects of Exo upon
adipocyte function were determined.
Results: Compared to control, MI/R Exo significantly
altered the expression of 17 genes known to be impor-
tant in adipocyte function. GO analysis revealed that
genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
function and adipocyte endocrine function are the
primary two pathways altered by MI/R Exo. Venn
analysis identified 11 mi-RNAs as cardiac-enriched,
adipocyte-poor, and ER function-related miRNAs.
RT-qPCR confirmed
the miR-23a/27a/24-2
family
members are the most markedly increased mi-RNAs
in MI/R Exo. Incubation of 3T3 L cells with mi-R27a
mimic significantly downregulated EDEM3, DsBA-L,
and PPARn, and upregulated PERK and CHOP.
Conversely, mi-R27a inhibitor significantly decreased
the impact of MI/R Exo upon ER function genes.
Additional studies demonstrated EDEM3 and PPARγ
(two critical molecules maintaining ER function and
adipocyte endocrine function) to be direct targets of
mi-R27a. One of the most significant endocrine mole-
cules of adipocyte origin, adiponectin is regulated by
PPARn at the transcriptional level and by DsBA-L at
the
post-translational
level.
We
next
determined
whether MI/R Exo may affect adiponectin expression/
assembly. Incubation of 3T3 L cells with MI/R Exo
significantly inhibited total and high molecular weight
adiponectin expression, an effect blocked by miR27a
mimic. Finally, in vivo administration of GW4869 (Exo
biogenesis inhibitor) or miR27a inhibitor attenuated
adipocyte ER dysfunction and restored plasma adipo-
nectin level in MI/R animals.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrate for the first
time that MI/R causes significant adipocyte ER and
endocrine dysfunction by Exo mediated cardiomyo-
cyte/adipocyte
communication
via
miR-23a/27a/

Pancreatic cancer cell extracellular vesicles drastically alter the behaviour
of recipient normal pancreas cells

Florida Health Science Center, Gainesville, USA
Introduction: Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is predicted to
become the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related deaths
by 2030. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a 5-year survival rate
~9%. Detection of pre-neoplastic lesions can poten-
tially improve survival. However, there is currently no
screening test for early stage detection. Importantly,
PaCa tumours are 90% non-tumorigenic cells. A better
understanding of early PaCa oncogenesis is needed.
Cancer cells shed extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are
internalized by neighbouring and distant cells to
induce a myriad of cancer progression events. We
hypothesize that in early PaCa oncogenesis, EVs med-
iate a behavioural change in surrounding normal cells,
leading to the formation of this unique stroma. The
purpose of this study was to develop a model to exam-
ine the phenotypic changes undergone by normal
human pancreas cells when they are exposed to PaCa
cell EVs.
Methods: EVs were isolated using differential ultracen-
trifugation with filtration from established (PANC-1,
SW-1990, Capan-1 and MiaPaCa-2) and patient-
derived xenograft (PPCL-46 and PPCL-68) PaCa cell
lines. Cells were grown using EV-depleted FBS. EV
isolations were validated and quantified using trans-
mission
electron
microscopy,
quantitative
ELISA,
immunoblot
and
nanoparticle
tracking
analysis.
Normal pancreas cells (hTERT-HPNE and HPDE-
H6c7) were co-cultured with cancer cell EVs for 24–
48 hours. Metabolic activity was measured using a Mito
Stress Test on a Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux
Analyser.
Results: We discovered that normal cells undergo vast
behavioural
transformations,
including
significant
morphological changes, increased proliferation and an
uncharacteristic invasive capability, when co-cultured
with PaCa cell EVs. These responses were EV dose
dependent. Further, PaCa cell EVs metabolically repro-
grammed normal cells, causing a bioenergetic switch,
from a quiescent, aerobic profile to a highly energetic
and glycolytic profile.

We hypothesize that EVs impart distinct transforma-

influence could unveil novel mechanisms regulating
cancer onset and progression. These signals may be
detectable before progression of early-stage PaCa to
PDAC, leading to the development of assays for ear-
lier diagnosis in patients. Further studies are under-
way to identify the biochemical mediators of these

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) containing
specific subset of functional biomolecules, such as
microRNAs (miRNAs) are released by all cell types.
It has been widely demonstrated that EV-miRNAs
from cancer cells can manipulate the tumour micro-
environment modulating the gene expression of reci-
pient cells. We previously identified a three levels risk
classifier (MSC) based on 24 plasma-miRNAs asso-
ciated with lung cancer development and prognosis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the potential
role of EV-24 miRNAs as mediators of pro-tumori-
genic features.
Methods: EVs were isolated from plasma of heavy-
smoker
individuals
with
high
(MSCpos)
or
low
(MSCneg) risk of lung cancer by differential centrifu-
gation method. Purity of EVs isolated was confirmed
by sizing using NTA and TEM analysis and expression
of EV-enriched proteins. miRNA levels were analysed
by dPCR. In vitro and in vivo analyses were used to
assess the biological effect of plasma EVs on different
recipient cells.
Results: Levels of miRNAs in EVs correlated with
determination of whole plasma (80% of correlation
with MSC classifier). MSCpos-EVs stimulated 2D and
3D proliferation of non-tumorigenic epithelial cells
through
c-myc
transfer
into
recipient
cells.
Furthermore, MSCpos-EVs increased the ability of
HUVEC to form tubular structures compared to
MSCneg-EVs. In vivo co-injection of MSCpos-EVs-
treated HUVEC with A549 lung cancer cells resulted
in
an
increase
of
tumour
growth
compared
to
MSCneg-EVs-treated HUVEC. miR-126 modulation
in EVs with miRNA mimics or in recipient cells
using
miRNA
inhibitors
demonstrated
that
this
miRNA is implicated in the autocrine proangiogenic
modulation
of
HUVEC
phenotype.
MSCpos-EVs
induced M2 polarization of macrophages both in
vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated using synthetic
oligonucleotides that miR-320 is responsible for the
immunosuppressive
modulation
of
these
cells.
Regarding the potential origin of EVs in MSCpos indi-
viduals, we observed that hypoxia stimulated the secre-
tion of EVs containing c-myc from fibroblasts, miR-
126-EVs from endothelial cells and miR-320-EVs from
granulocytes.
Summary/Conclusion: These data show that plasma
EVs of high-risk individuals display pro-tumorigenic
features, as documented by their ability to induce a
pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive microenviron-
ment suggesting an involvement of EVs in lung cancer
development.

strated the decrease of CD63 tetraspanin expression in
melanoma cells are correlated with enhancing its meta-
static potential. However, other proteins, such as
CD44, CD47, MET and NRP2 which are overexpressed
in melanoma cells, are also associated with the spread
of cancer. In this study, we sought to investigate the
expression of metastatic proteins in EVs derived from
murine melanoma B16F10 lineage.
Methods: B16F10 cells were cultured in DMEM sup-
plemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. The cells

through 0.22 µm and ultracentrifuged at 110000 x g
for 90 min at 4ºC to pellet EVs. Next, size and con-
centration was determined using nanoparticle tracking
analyses technique, and the morphology of EVs were
analysed by negative-staining transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The EV’s surface protein were
characterized by flow cytometry and protein content
was profiled by mass spectrometry.
Results: Our flow cytometry results have shown the
presence of tetraspanins markers CD63, CD9 and
CD81 on vesicle´s surface. In addition, our assay
demonstrated a diminished expression of CD63 mole-
cule in comparison to CD9 and CD81. We have pro-
filed melanoma-EVs by mass spectrometry, identifying
the presence of proteins that may be associated to
metastasis, such as CD44, CD47, MET and NRP2.
Summary/Conclusion: These preliminary results are
consistent with the literature and suggest that mela-
noma-derived EVs harbour proteins, which may con-
tribute to promote tumour metastasis. In our next step,
we plan to generate B16F10 lineages harbouring
shRNA vectors, in order to knockdown gene expres-
sion of CD63, CD44, CD47, MET and NRP2 to inves-
tigate the metastatic potential in vitro, in comparison
to parental cells. We also may use syngeneic mice
models to explore metastatic potential of genetically
modified B16 F10-derived cells.

Analysing extracellular vesicles from drug-resistant and drug-sensitive
cancer cells as potential predictive biomarkers in the liquid biopsy
Sarai Martinez Pacheco and Lorraine O’ Driscoll
Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland
Introduction: Overexpression of HER2 occurs in ~
20% of breast cancers and confers aggressive beha-
viour and poorer prognosis. Thankfully, a number of
drugs such as neratinib have been developed to target
HER2, potentially providing substantial benefit for
many patients. Nevertheless, it is estimated that up
to
70%
of
patients
with
HER2-overexpressing
tumours do not gain benefit, as a result of innate or
acquired drug-resistance. This study aimed to inves-
tigate if nano-sized membrane-surrounded extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs) released from drug-sensitive and
drug-resistant cells reflect the HER2 status of their
cells of origin and thus have potential as minimally-
invasive biomarkers.
Methods: EVs were isolated from conditioned media
(CM) of HER2-positive cell lines (HCC1954 and
SKBR3)
and
their
neratinib-resistant
counterparts
(HCC1954-NR and SKBR3-NR) that we developed in
our laboratory. EVs from CM of a triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) cell line variant, Hs578 Ts(i)8,
were evaluated as negative control for HER2. In brief,
CM was centrifuged at 300 g, for 10 min x3 to get rid
of any cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at
200,000 g for 6 h at 4ºC to collect EVs. The resulting
EVs were washed in PBS, centrifuged as before, and re-
suspended in 100 μL PBS. EV quantities were estimated
by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTS). EV lysates
were characterised by immunoblots, for established
positive and negative EV markers. Particle concentra-
tion as well as size distribution of EVs were measured
using
the
ZetaView
(Particle
Metrix,
Germany).
Surface proteins on single EVs were analysed by high-
resolution flow cytometry (FC), using an AMNIS
ImageStreamX Mark II. All data was submitted to
EV-TRACK (EV-TRACK ID: EV190112).
Results: Neratinib-resistant cell line variants were
found to have reduced HER2 protein expression com-
pared to their respective drug-sensitive counterparts.
Neratinib-resistant cell line variants released fewer
EVs, when normalised per number of secreting cells,
compared
to
their-drug
sensitive
counterparts.
Furthermore, EVs from drug-sensitive cells carried
HER2, while those from drug-resistant cells lacked
HER2 (similar to the EVs from the TNBC cells);
reflecting the HER2 status of their cells of origin.
Summary/Conclusion: This study indicates that a
reduction in HER2 protein expression is a mechan-
ism by which cancer cells manifest resistance to
HER2-targeted drugs (i.e. by making fewer HER2
receptors available on the cells surface to accommo-
date the drugs activity). Furthermore, EV-carried
HER2 seems to reflect the HER2 status of their
cells of origin. This suggest that analysis of HER2
on EVs in the peripheral circulation may help pre-
dict response to HER2-targeted drugs. Thus, analysis
of EVs in appropriate cohorts of patients’ specimens
is warranted.

Introduction: Rab27a, a small GTPase involved in
exosome biogenesis by regulating MVE docking at the
plasma membrane, and its expression level highly cor-
related
with
oHSV
replication
ability
in
vitro.
Oncolytic viruses is a newly promising therapeutic
agent for cancer treatment. However, more than 50%
of tumours naturally showed highly resistant to onco-
lytic viruses for unknown reasons. Uncovering the
underlying mechanisms of resistance to oHSV can
offer potential therapeutic targets to enhance oHSV
activity to kill tumour cells. In addition, it will give
new insights into the identification of therapeutic bio-
markers, which can be used to predict patient response
to oHSV in clinical.
Methods: Deep-sequencing data showed that lower
expression level of Rab27a is present in oHSV resistant
tumour cells compared to that in sensitive tumour
cells. Then an oHSV resistant MC38 tumour cell line
was established by repeated injections with oHSV in
MC38 tumour-bear mouse model. Lastly, it was veri-
fied that oHSV resistance is associated with a down-
regulation of Rab27a and overexpression of Rab27a can
rescue oHSV replication.
Results: 1) The lower expression level of Rab27a is
shown in oHSV resistant tumour cells compared to
that in sensitive tumour cells shows in Deep-sequen-
cing data. 2) Furthermore, we established an oHSV
resistant MC38 tumour cell line by repeated injections
with oHSV in MC38 tumour-bear mouse model.
Similarly, in oHSV resistant MC38 cell line, Rab27a
expression was lower than parental MC38 cells. And
the release of exosomes and virus was decreased in
oHSV resistant MC38 cell line. These results were
confirmed by Rab27a siRNA knockdown. 3) We ver-
ified that in oHSV naturally resistant human cancer
cell lines, oHSV resistance is associated with a down-
regulation of Rab27a and overexpression of Rab27a can
rescue oHSV replication.
Summary/Conclusion:
Downregulation
of
Rab27a
expression restricts the efficiency of oHSV replication
and the spreading ability of the released progeny virus
which also provide Rab27a as a potential target and
biomarker for oHSV cancer therapy.

Introduction: Studies have demonstrated that mela-
noma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) home in dis-
tal
organs
and
sentinel
lymph
nodes
favouring
metastasis. Although lymph node metastases are them-
selves rarely life threatening, they could be considered
as one of the first step of metastasis in many cancer
types. Therefore, defining the mechanisms involved in
lymph node metastasis and pre-metastatic niche for-
mation in lymph nodes could bring the clue to block
the metastatic process from the beginning.
Methods: We have characterized secreted exosomes from
a panel of mouse melanoma models representative of low
metastatic potential (B16-F1), high metastatic potential
(B16-F10) and lymph node metastasis (B16-F1 R2). We
analysed the RNA expression in cells and protein content
of exosomes derived from mouse melanoma lymph node
metastatic models by RNA sequencing and mass spectro-
metry respectively. We validated expression by Western-
Blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence. To define the
mechanism of EMILIN-1 secretion cells were treated
with the EV secretion inhibitor (non-competitive inhibi-
tor of sphingomyelinase), GW4869. Cell viability and cell
cycle assays with an overexpression model (B16-F1-
EMILIN-1) were also performed. In vivo experiments
based on subcutaneous and intrafootpad injection for
studying the role of this protein during melanoma pro-
gression were performed to define the relevance of our
findings in vivo. Human paraffin samples were analysed
for EMILIN-1 expression by immunohistochemistry.
Results: We found a signature of over-expressed genes
and hyper-secreted proteins in exosomes related to
lymph node metastasis in the B16 mouse melanoma
model. Among them, we found that EMILIN-1, a protein
with an important function in lymph node physiology,

was hyper-secreted in exosomes. Interestingly, we found
that EMILIN-1 is degraded and secreted in exosomes as a
mechanism favouring metastasis. Further, we found that
EMILIN-1 has a tumour suppressive-like role regulating
negatively cell migration. Importantly, our in vivo studies
demonstrate that EMILIN-1 overexpression reduced pri-
mary tumour growth and metastasis in mouse melanoma
models. Analysis in human melanoma samples showed
that cells expressing high levels of EMILIN-1 are reduced
in metastatic lesions.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, our analysis suggests
that the inactivation of EMILIN-1 by proteolysis and
secretion in exosomes reduce its intrinsic tumour sup-
pressive activities in melanoma favouring tumour pro-
gression and metastasis.

Introduction: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a lead-
ing cause of chronic kidney disease. This complication
of diabetes develops in about 10% of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) patients as a result of chronic hyper-
glycaemia. Urine is a reach reservoir of extracellular
vesicles (EVs) released by glomerular epithelial cells
present in the urinary tract. The alterations in molecu-
lar content of EVs related to the disease state make
them promising biomarkers for DKD.
Methods: T2DM patients with different stage of dia-
betic kidney disease (n = 24) and healthy subjects
(n = 7) were enrolled to the study. Patients were
classified into 4 groups according to the estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR CKD-EPI) level: G2
eGFR = 60–89, G3 eGFR = 30–59, G4 eGFR = 15–29,
G5 eGFR <15 ml/min/1.73cm2. The study protocol was
approved by the Jagiellonian University Bioethics
Committee (permission no. 1072.6120.268.2018 from
25 October 2018). Urinary EVs were isolated using
low vacuum filtration method followed by ultracentri-
fugation. Raman spectra of urinary EVs were recorded
using a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer. Data
analysis was performed using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
(HCA). The size distribution and morphology of EVs
were analysed by Transmission Electron Microscopy
and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis methods.
Results: Average Raman spectra obtained for urinary
EVs
from

groups
showed
differences
in
intensities of specific bands in the region of 400–
1800 cm-1. We found significant correlations between
mean area under curve (AUC) calculated for Raman
bands (phenylalanine, DNA, Proteins, Lipids and
Amide I) and selected clinical parameters such as:
eGFR, serum creatinine, glucose, urine creatinine.

vesicles (EVs) and cell free DNA (cfDNA)) to non-
invasively detect ERBB2 gene status in the blood.
However, the isolation of diverse tumour–derived
materials from a single aliquot of patients’ plasma
and the accurate detection of cancer biomarkers is
still challenging.
Methods: By adopting a recently published nickel – based
EVs isolation (NBI) protocol1 that allows for recovery of
cfDNA after EVs isolation, we generated a high-sensitiv-
ity molecular assay to accurately detect ERBB2 amplifica-
tion and consequent HER2 overexpression on a limited
volume of plasma (1.5 ml) collected from breast cancer
patients (stage I, II and III) at diagnosis.
Results: 1) we detected ERBB2 amplifications by
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on the cfDNA isolated
from the plasma of ERBB2 positive patients; 2) we
confirmed HER2 overexpression on a subset of
patients by setting up an antibody–based affinity
reaction designed to detect HER2 protein on the
surface of the isolated EVs; 3) we succeeded in the
quantification of HER2 transcripts enclosed within
EVs by performing ddPCR in samples of patients
showing a range of circulating tumour – derived
material. The specificity and sensitivity of these
novel methodological assays were tested on a cohort
of healthy individuals (n = 20) and on a cohort of
HER2 positive (n = 20) or HER2 negative breast
cancer patients (TNBC; n = 20).
Summary/Conclusion: Here we report a pilot study on
a novel multimodal method for ERBB2 detection from
a minimal amount of plasma. This approach integrates
information from cfDNA with EVs-derived RNA and
proteins analysis. This proof of concept may ultimately
translate into relevant clinical applications for disease
diagnosis as well as for therapy selection and monitor-
ing of disease progression.

Introduction: The biological and medical importance
of exosomes recognized over the last decade has given
rise to a crucial need for the discrimination between
true EVs and co-purified nanoparticles, such as lipo-
proteins, protein aggregates or debris. Additionally, it
is imperative to develop methods to identify and char-
acterize EV sub-populations. Considering EV biology
and the reliability of labelled biomolecules, we devel-
oped both exogenous and endogenous labelling proto-
cols, taking advantage of different dye properties which
can target a multitude of compartments. This approach
reveals key aspects of EV structure and integrity.
Methods: Nanosized EVs/exosomes were purified by
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) from model cell
lines and human plasma. Diverse dyes were orthogon-
ally evaluated through different single particle and bulk
analysis technologies, such as high-resolution cytome-
try, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis and plate fluori-
meter.
Concomitant
profiling
of
specific
EV
subpopulations was optimized using antibodies (Abs)
against tetraspanins and cell type specific targets and
assessed by single particle analysis and ELISA. To
assess specificity of labelling protocols we used specific
controls such as recombinant RFP expressing vesicles
and purified lipoproteins.
Results: Our EV staining protocols allowed for high
labelling efficiency and unprecedent EV discrimina-
tion, quantification and characterization by combining
single particle analysis and bulk measurements in
simple matrices (saline buffers) and in complex bio-
fluids (i.e. plasma). Different approaches have diverse
and complementary advantages (costs, capacity, sensi-
tivity, informative readout) for implementation in
research and diagnostic development flows, directly
feeding in-house R&D and QC pipeline.
Summary/Conclusion: Overall, fluorescent EVs are
versatile and valuable tracers that can be applied in
the optimization of pre-analytical and purification pro-
tocols, selection of target biomarkers and diagnostic
assay calibration and validation.

Introduction: Introduction: Subpopulations of extra-
cellular vesicle (EVs) are commonly classified by their
different size, however, the EV size cut off is still under
discussion. The aim of the study was to evaluate size
range of six EV subpopulations using three methods:
electron microscopy (EM), nanoparticle tracking ana-
lysis (NTA) and ExoView™.
Methods: Methods: EV subpopulations were isolated
from melanoma tissues by a centrifugation based pro-
tocol recently established in our lab. Large and small
EVs (lEVs and sEVs) were isolated with differential
ultracentrifugation and these were further separated
into low and high-density fractions (LD and HD).
Size of EV subpopulations was then evaluated by: EM

EVs LD and HD), NTA (N = 7) and ExoView™(N = 1).
Results: Results: Tissue-derived large and small EVs

when
examined

EM,
whereas
NTA
and
ExoView™were unable to show a clear difference
between the populations (NTA: mean 125.7 nm vs
122 nm, ExoView™: mean 81.7 nm vs 69.2 nm).
After iodixanol density gradients, lEVs-LD were
significantly larger in size than the sEVs-LD as
determined by EM (mean 128.1 nm vs. 67.3 nm)
but
no
difference
was
observed
by
NTA
and
ExoView™(NTA: mean 134.1 nm vs 124.5 nm,
ExoView™: mean 71.1 nm vs 63 nm). HD vesicles
from both large and small EVs were the smallest in
size when analysed by EM (mean size 41 nm vs
34 nm) but no significant difference was observed
by NTA and ExoView™(NTA: mean 127.8 nm vs
116 nm, ExoView™: mean 98 nm vs 66.4 nm).
Summary/Conclusion: Conclusions: Different meth-
ods have different limitations: EM preparations can
shrink vesicles, NTA can only detected vesicles above
70 nm and ExoView™only measures vesicles between
50–200 nm. Of the three different methods, EM analy-
sis of single vesicles visualized in a significant number
of micrographs was the only one able to distinguish EV
subpopulations by size.

Introduction: Small-extracellular vesicles have an impor-
tant role in cell metabolism and cell-to-cell communica-
tion. Moreover, sEVs when secreted from cells are
capable to act as mediators of various neurological dis-
eases. However, sEVs show heterogeneity and this may
impact their functions. Therefore, to characterize sEVs at
a single-particle level is important to better detail the
associated
biological
activity.
In
this
scenario,
we
innovatively
propose
the
Structured
Illumination
Microscopy (SIM) as a technique able to complement
the
non-optical
methods
(Transmission
Electron
Microscopy, TEM) to analyse single sEVs and their
markers.
Methods: Human plasma sEVs were separated from
healthy
cognitive
control
(ctrl),
Mild
Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) and demented subjects. The sEVs-
containing pellet was resuspended in 4% paraformalde-
hyde or 2% glutaraldehyde solutions. For SIM, sEVs-
enriched preparations were washed with the blocking
solution and incubated with the primary antibody
(L1CAM). The secondary fluolabelled antibody was
then added. Between the steps with the blocking solution,
the primary and secondary antibodies, two ultracentri-
fuge steps were performed. The image acquisition was
done on a Nikon SIM system with a 100x oil immersion
objective. sEVs were imaged with a 3D-SIM acquisition
protocol. TEM was performed on 300 mesh formvar
copper-coated grids. sEVs-enriched preparations were
incubated first with the blocking solution and then,
immunogold-labelled for CD63. Samples were counter-
stained with uranyl acetate and observed under a Jeol
1010 EX electron microscope. Data were recorded with
a MORADA digital camera system. Participation to the
present study was approved by relevant local ethics com-
mittee of Mendrisio and Lugano Hospital and written
informed consents were obtained from subjects.
Results: For SIM methodology, only vesicles in the
range from 180 to 190 nm were detected, as the final
resolution achieved was 160 nm. Instead, for TEM,
sEVs under 100 nm were identified. None of these
methods provided relevant information about possible
difference in morphology of the ctrl-, MCI or demen-
ted subjects-derived sEVs.
Summary/Conclusion: Even if both methods identified
CD63 or L1CAM-positive vesicles, SIM resolution and
the complexity of the protocol represent some disad-
vantages respect to TEM, that may be the first choice
screening technique for EVs analysis to be then com-
pleted by SIM for particular tasks.

Introduction: Electrofluidics is an emerging technol-
ogy of combining electronics and nanofluidics. One
important device in electrofluidics is an ion transistor
in which the ionic current through a nanopore is
regulated by gate voltage bias. Here, we suggest a
fabrication
method
of
nanopore
by
introducing
focused ion beam (FIB) and atomic layer deposition
(ALD) to sense extracellular vesicle (EV) via metal
electrode structures.
Methods: We deposited 100 nm-thick silicon-nitrite layers
on both sides of silicon wafer by low-pressure chemical
vapour deposition (LPCVD). We fabricated rectangular
patterns by photolithography followed by reactive ion
etching (RIE) on the backside of the wafer. Anisotropic
silicon etching by KOH was performed. The front side of
the chip was patterned by photolithography followed by
Ti/Au deposition for the fabrication of electrode structures.
We drilled 50 ~ 100 nm pores in the Si3N4 membrane by
FIB. By the ALD process, we deposited highly-conformal
metal film, either Platinum (Pt) or Ruthenium (Ru) to
shrink nanopores by a self limiting process.
Results: We expect that the ion current through the
nanopore is efficiently controlled by the gate-surround-
ing structures. The nanopore ion transistor can be used
to count the number of EVs.
Summary/Conclusion:
we
suggest
a
fabrication
method of nanopore ion transistors by introducing
focused ion beam (FIB) and atomic layer deposition
(ALD). This device will be applicable for single EV
sensing.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key
players in cell-cell communication and increasing evi-
dence has shown that EVs function in cancer by pro-
moting cancer cell motility and metastasis. Analysing
tumour-derived EVs in biofluids is attractive because it
would be a novel approach to a non-invasive liquid
biopsy. Unfortunately, EVs are highly heterogeneous.
They vary greatly in size, lipid composition, and cargo
and are difficult to distinguish from other small parti-
cles in complex biofluids. We have developed a novel
flow cytometry method to generate a distinct EV fin-

Methods: EVs from cell culture media (purified and

populations were visualized with dimensional reduc-
tion (t-SNE and UMAP) of 20–150 features that

Unsupervised density based clustering (HDBSCAN)
in conjunction with supervised machine learning

Results: EV Fingerprinting was successfully used to detect
EVs in complex biological specimens and trace their dif-
ferential enrichment through conventional purification
methods. EVs were readily distinguished from protein
complexes,

and
non-lipid

Calibration with externally validated purified EV, as well
as size, lipid, and fluorescence standards enabled EV
Fingerprinting as a rigorous and reproducible method for
resolving heterogenous EV samples. EV Fingerprinting
applied to conditioned medium from tumour cells and
biological fluids from cancer patients reveals unique EV
profiles generated by cancer, further supporting the poten-
tial of EV fingerprinting as a liquid biopsy.
Summary/Conclusion:
Our
single-EV

approach characterizes whole EV populations in com-
plex biological fluids without the need for purification,
reducing time intensive purification protocols and sub-
sequent sample loss, permitting efficient analysis of
liquid biopsy samples.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are mem-
brane-derived structures that include exosomes, micro-
vesicles, and apoptotic bodies. These EVs – released
under normal physiological conditions as well as in the
pathogenesis of neurological, vascular, haematological,
and autoimmune diseases – have been shown to trans-
fer biological molecules such as protein and RNA
between cells, potentially transmitting signals. To
understand more about these signalling mechanisms,
there is a need for detecting and quantifying EVs with
cargo protein and RNA in a reproducible and reliable
manner. However, this has been challenging due to the
small size of EVs (ranging from 30 to 100 nm in
diameter), and the lack of specific staining reagents.
Methods: Here, we utilize the Amnis® CellStream® Flow
Cytometer, which enables high-throughput flow cyto-
metry with increased sensitivity for detecting small
particles. We demonstrate that a charge-coupled device
(CCD)-based, time-delay-integration image capturing
system can be used to detect and quantify EVs and
their
cargo
labelled
with
ExoGlow™-Protein
or
ExoGlow™-RNA.
Results: In this study, we show flow cytometry data
quantifying EV samples that have been labelled with
cargo markers for proteins and RNA. The EV cargo
contents along with the appropriate control samples
will be shown.
Summary/Conclusion: The CCD based detection of
the CellStream Flow Cytometer has the sensitivity to
quantify EVs and their cargo.

Introduction: Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are cell-
derived membrane-bound particles that range in size
from 30–1000 nm and carry active molecules such as
DNA, RNA and proteins. Upon secretion, EVs can
execute many biological functions such as initiating
intracellular communication or regulating immune
responses. Depending on their origin EVs have differ-
ent characteristics and cargo, making them attractive
candidates for early diagnostic and therapeutic applica-
tions. However due to their small size and heterogene-
ity, direct visualization and characterization of the
surface markers expressed remains a challenge since
these vesicles are below the resolution limit of standard
light microscopy.
Methods: Here, we describe a method that provides
size analysis of single-EVs, which falls below the dif-
fraction limit of light. This was done with purified EVs,
immunostained using fluorescently labelled primary
antibodies raised against EV surface markers (CD63,
CD81, CD9), specific cargo such as DNA and probed
for tissue specific cargo. Characterization of the mole-
cular content and structural properties of surface-
immobilized EVs was performed using single-molecule
localisation microscopy (SMLM) on the Nanoimager
platform.
Results: Multicolour SMLM was used to detect up to
three EV biomarkers showing successful characteriza-
tion of the molecular signature for different EV sub-
populations. The distribution of novel components on
urinary EVs were visualized for the first time using this
approach. In addition, SMLM revealed the presence of
DNA on both the surface and also as a cargo inside
EVs isolated from tumour cell culture media, which
was
validated
using
complementary
biochemical
characterization.
Summary/Conclusion: SMLM is a powerful technique
for
single-EV
analysis
and
characterization.
Visualization of single-urinary EVs enabled accurate
sizing and further insights into novel components
expressed on the subpopulation’s membrane surface.
Together, the data demonstrates that the quantitative
abilities of SMLM can significantly enhance our under-
standing of EVs, as structure, phenotypes, and cargoes
can now be successfully resolved.

Extracellular vesicles, microRNA and muscle damage

aStellenbosch University, Matieland, South Africa; bStellenbosch Univeristy,
Matieland, South Africa
Introduction: Working skeletal muscle is a common
site for injury due to unaccustomed exercise with or
without underlying pathology. Direct analysis of SkM
injury requires invasive tissue biopsies. Circulating
extracellular vesicles (EVs) are abundant in blood and
have been shown to be enriched in microRNA; profiles
of which may reflect the state of tissues. EVs may
therefore serve as a non-invasive indicator of muscle
injury and regenerative processes in vivo.
Methods: Two consecutive bouts of muscle-damaging
exercise (plyometric jumping and downhill running)
were performed by 9 healthy male volunteers. Serum
creatine kinase (CK) and plasma EVs were analysed at
baseline, 2 and 24 hr post-exercise. Perceived muscle
pain (PMP) was assessed at 2 and 24 hr post-exercise.
Large EVs were isolated using a 10 000 G centrifuga-
tion step, and small EVs were isolated using qEV
columns. EV-enriched isolates were visualized using
TEM, and size and numbers were quantified using
NTA. Based on NTA results the highest particle frac-
tions (7–10) were pooled for RNA analysis. qPCR was
done on plasma, large EVs and small EVs. A group of
muscle and immune cell-important miRs were ana-
lysed by means of normalization to an exogenous
control.
Results: CK and PMP increased post-exercise, provid-
ing evidence for muscle damage. TEM revealed an
abundant and heterogeneous pool of EVs. A concomi-
tant abundance of EVs was seen with NTA (mean = 1.17
x 1010 particles/ml plasma). Mean EV diameters were
194 ± 22 nm across all timepoints. No change in EV
size nor number was seen over time, however, miR-31
decreased at 24 hr when compared to 2 hr in the small
EV isolate only. Plasma displayed an immediate
increase in myomiRs-1 and −206 at 2 hr, which
returned to baseline at 24 hr. In contrast, myomiRs-
208b and 486 remained elevated over the 24 hr period.
MyomiR-133b and 486, as well as immune-miRs, did
not change in EVs or plasma as a result of the
intervention.
Summary/Conclusion: The decrease in miR-31 in
small EVs at 24 hr is consistent with previous data.
No decrease in miR-31 in large EVs suggests specific
packaging and hence a specific response to the muscle
damage in small EVs. More changes occurred in
plasma myomiRs suggesting less specific passive leak-
age into circulation from damaged cell membranes.

Introduction: The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
secretome, via the combined actions of its plethora of
biologically active factors, is capable of orchestrating
the regenerative responses of numerous tissues by both
eliciting and amplifying biological responses within
recipient cells. MSCs are “environmentally-responsive”
to local microenvironmental cues and biophysical per-
turbations, influencing their differentiation as well as
secretion of bioactive factors. We have previously
shown that exposures of MSCs to pulsed electromag-
netic fields (PEMFs) enhanced MSC chondrogenesis.
Here, we investigate the influence of PEMF exposure
over the paracrine activity of MSCs and its significance
to cartilage regeneration. Also, the subsequent extra-
cellular vesicles analysis and isolation are processed for
the understanding of how the PEMFs affect stem cell
EVs and consequent differentiation induction.
Methods: Conditioned medium (CM) was generated
from MSCs subjected to either 3D or 2D culturing
platforms, with or without PEMF exposure. The para-
crine effects of CM over chondrocytes and MSC chon-
drogenesis, migration and proliferation, as well as the
inflammatory status and induced apoptosis in chon-
drocytes and MSCs was assessed. The CMs which have

significant effects during chondrogenesis will be ana-
lysed by protein and miRNA studies.
Results: We show that the benefits of magnetic field
stimulation over MSC-derived chondrogenesis can be
partly ascribed to its ability to modulate the MSC secre-
tome. MSCs cultured on either 2D or 3D platforms dis-
played distinct magnetic sensitivities, whereby MSCs
grown in 2D or 3D platforms responded most favourably
to PEMF exposure at 2 mT and 3 mT amplitudes, respec-
tively. Ten minutes of PEMF exposure was sufficient to
substantially augment the chondrogenic potential of
MSC-derived CM generated from either platform.
Furthermore, PEMF-induced CM was capable of enhan-
cing the migration of chondrocytes and MSCs as well as
mitigating cellular inflammation and apoptosis.
The CMs protein results in the significant promo-
tion chondrogenesis condition showed an increase in
proliferation and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
Summary/Conclusion: The findings reported here
demonstrate that PEMF-stimulation is capable of mod-
ulating the paracrine function of MSCs for the
enhancement and re-establishment of cartilage regen-
eration in states of cellular stress. The PEMF-induced
modulation of the MSC-derived paracrine function for
directed biological responses 1 in recipient cells or
tissues has broad clinical and practical ramifications
with high translational value across numerous clinical
application.

Introduction: The degenerative disease osteoarthritis
(OA) is one of the leading causes of disability especially
of elderly people. Besides various treatment options
depending on the severity of the cartilage degradation,
the application of blood derived products such as pla-
telet rich plasma (PRP) are getting more and more
popular in clinical practice due to its high concentra-
tion of platelets and the perceived high growth factor
levels. Drawbacks of using PRP include high donor
variability, discrepancies among preparation protocols
and the presence of cells (platelets, leukocytes) which
can evoke cellular processes, especially inflammation,
when injected into the diseased tissue. One possibility
is to isolate only extracellular vesicles (EVs) from blood
derivatives to overcome these problems. In the current
study the effects of EVs isolated from blood derivatives
on OA chondrocytes within an inflammation model
was investigated.
Methods: CD14 positive primary monocytes were iso-
lated from citrate anticoagulated whole blood by mag-
netic bead sorting. Monocytes were differentiated into
resting M0 macrophages and activated into M1 macro-
phages according to published protocols. ELISA measure-
ments verified successful differentiation and activation as
IL1β and TNFα levels increased. As control, THP1 mono-
cytes were used. Patient-derived OA chondrocytes were
grown in 6 well plates and co-cultivated with activated
M1 macrophages which were seeded into thincerts and
added to the 6 wells representing the inflammation
model. Furthermore, cells were treated for 48 hours
with media containing FCS, EV depleted FCS or EVs
isolated from PRP or hypACT serum.
Results: Successful differentiation and activation of
monocytes (THP1 and primary monocytes) into M1
macrophages was demonstrated by elevated levels of
the inflammatory cytokines IL1β and TNFα. Within
the inflammation model (co-culture of OA chondro-
cytes with M1 macrophages), addition of EVs isolated
from PRP or hypACT serum resulted in decreased
secretion levels of IL1β and TNFα compared to media
supplemented with either FCS or EV depleted FCS.
Summary/Conclusion:
Taken
together,
EVs
from
blood derived products might be chondroprotective
and anti-inflammatory mediators which protect carti-
lage from being degraded during OA.

Introduction: Matrix vesicles (MVs) are small (50–
150 nm in diameter) lipid bound extracellular orga-
nelles isolated from calcifying tissues including the
growth zone (GC) of growth plate cartilage. 1α,25
(OH)2 vitamin D3 (1α,25) is a regulator of GC chon-
drocytes and the MVs they produce. These MVs are
key players in the mineralization process and are selec-
tively enriched with enzymes and growth factors. We
found that MVs are also selectively enriched with

microRNAs (miR), including miR-22, miR-122 and
miR-451. The aim of this study was to determine the
regulatory role of 1α,25 in the packaging of miRNA in
MVs by GC cells.
Methods: GC cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion
from costochondral GC cartilage harvested from 5 wk-old
male Sprague Dawley rats (IACUC approved). Confluent
fourth passage GC cell cultures were treated with 10–8 M
1α,25 or vehicle for 24 h. Media were removed, cell mono-
layers digested with trypsin and cells and MVs isolated by
differential ultracentrifugation. RNA was precipitated
from cells and MVs. Small RNAseq data were trimmed,
aligned and counted before undergoing differential expres-
sion analysis. Experimental groups had an n = 3 per vari-
able. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were determined
using R v 3.6.2.
Results: 1α,25 treatment altered expression of 30 MV miRs
compared to control MVs, whereas 5 cell miRNAs were
differentially expressed. 62.1% of significantly up or down
regulated miR found in MVs overlapped between 1α,25
and vehicle groups with the remaining being uniquely
differentially expressed. 1α,25 increased MV miR-150
and decreased miR-384-3p two miRs known to regulate
osteoblast proliferation (150 increases, 384 decreases).
Summary/Conclusion: 1α,25 regulates GC chondro-
cyte and MV behaviour and this study demonstrates
that it also impacts the miR packaging within MVs.
MiR discovered in MVs have been demonstrated to
impact chondrocyte behaviour and the present study
indicates that 1α,25 regulates the growth plate through
miR delivered by MVs.

Introduction: Increasing evidence has proposed extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) as mediators of many of the
therapeutic features of mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSC) that have been widely studied in clinical trials
over the last years. These EVs have been recognized as
nanocarriers
of
important
biological
information,
which play a central role in cell-to-cell communication.
In this context, EVs can be used as an alternative to a
cell-based therapy, with reduced risks. The present
work aimed to evaluate the impact of different culture
conditions on the MSC-derived EVs molecular compo-
sition through Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR)
spectroscopy.
Methods: EVs derived from MSC from different
sources, expanded in two different culture media
((xenogeneic -free (XF) vs serum-containing medium
(FBS)) were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, a
highly sensitive, fast and high throughput technique.
Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of pre-
processed FTIR spectra of purified EVs was conducted,
enabling the evaluation of the replica variance of the
EVs chemical fingerprint in a reduced dimensionality
space. For that, different pre-processing methods were
studied as baseline correction, standard normal varia-
tion and first and second derivative.
Results: EVs secreted by MSCs cultured with serum-
containing medium presented a more homogenous
chemical fingerprint than EVs obtained with XF med-
ium. The regression vector of the PCA enabled to
identified relevant spectral bands that enabled the
separation of samples in the score-plot of the previous
analysis. Ratios between these spectral bands were
determined, since these attenuate artefacts due to cell
quantity and baseline distortions underneath each
band. Statistically inference analysis of the ratios of
spectral bands were conducted, by comparing the
equality of the means of the populations using appro-
priate hypothesis tests and considering the significance
level of 5%. It was possible to define ratios of spectral
bands, that can be used as biomarkers, enabling the
discrimination of EVs chemical fingerprint in function
of the culture medium used for MSC expansion and
the MSC donor.
Summary/Conclusion: This work is a step forward
into understanding how different culture conditions
affect MSC-derived EVs characteristics.

Introduction: As microflow cytometry and other tech-
niques mature as validated modalities for analysing
extracellular vesicles (EV), there has been a concerted
effort to improve reproducibility . In order for this
reproducibility to occur there has to be a critical under-
standing of advantages and limitations for each tech-
nology. For microflow cytometry, several instruments
are available to analyse EVs. Each platform has differ-
ent limitations as well as advantages over other plat-
forms. To provide the optimal data for your specific
research, it is critical to understand the limitations of
your platform. To accurately define these limitations, a
performance qualification (PQ) of your instrument
should be undertaken.
Methods: An Apogee A60 platform was used in these
experiments. Experiments were designed with expected
ranges and cut-offs for acceptance criteria.Initial tests
included autosampling of a 96 well plate with either single
or double aspiration, single sample reproducibility and

linearity proportional to flow rate. Other experiments
designed to show machine performance included minimal
time to achieve valid data, sample volume required for
double aspiration, determination of coincidence; detection
sensitivity using a spiked sample; flow rate stability for
extended periods (5–30 minutes). Tests should also be
performed to determine carryover at a range of sample
concentrations. If present, the means to remove contam-
inating samples should be determined. Any performance
tests should be applicable to any instrument in the field.
Results: Auto-sampling helped demonstrate consistent
data; reproducibility of total events and biomarkers was
2–8% C.V. Detected bead concentrations were linear with
flow rates between 0.75 and 10.5 uL/min. Double well
aspirations provided similar data with aspirations between
60–80uL. Valid data was achieved for a low abundant
target (~200-400 events/uL) after only 30 s, <10%C.V.
Detection sensitivity was determined to be ~1/400,000.
Carryover ranges were determined in the presence of
nominal unstained serum. An optimal number of machine
washes was determined. Some membrane stains, such as
cell mask and CFSE require much more rigorous cleaning
to remove stain carryover.
Summary/Conclusion: To improve data reproducibil-
ity, performance qualification of any instrument is key.
Operational limitations help define optimal perfor-
mance parameters of any technology. Understanding
the types of experiments to perform for your particular
type of characterization technology depends on the
requirements you set for your research. A good perfor-
mance test should be applicable to any related instru-
ment in the field.

Introduction: The particle size distribution (PSD) of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) is commonly measured by
tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) and nanopar-
ticle tracking analysis (NTA). Both TRPS and NTA
have limitations that hamper the accurate measure-
ment of the PSD of EVs, specifically in the size range
from 50 to 100 nm. An alternative technique for
measuring the PSD of EVs is micro-fluidic resistive
pulse sensing (MRPS). Because a standard operating
procedure (SOP) for characterizing EVs by MRPS is
absent, we aim to establish a reliable SOP to ensure
reproducible PSD measurements of EVs by MRPS.
Methods: Measurements (n = 3) of red-blood cell,
prostate cancer cell line supernatant, and human
urine and plasma EVs were acquired in 10 × 10 s
acquisitions. Two microfluidic cartridges were used to
study a dynamic range of 50–450 nm. Samples were
diluted into phosphate buffered saline with different
concentrations of Tween 20 or BSA. Because the excess
of particles affects the detection limit, serial dilutions
were performed to find the optimal dilution for each
sample. Data were evaluated using Data Viewer
software.
Results: The optimal dilution was determined for
each sample by maximizing the particle rate and mini-
mizing the measurement time while preserving a
robust detection limit of 50 or 65 nm. Moreover, we
developed a procedure to optimize the peak filter
settings of Data Viewer by fitting data to normal
distributions and identifying threshold values for sig-
nal-to-noise ratio, symmetry, and transit time within
99% confidence.
Summary/Conclusion: We recommend to use 0.1% w/
v BSA in DPBS as sample diluent, because Tween 20
affects EVs as confirmed by flow cytometry. By using
orthogonal techniques and well-characterized biologi-
cal test samples, we developed and validated a SOP for
EV detection by MRPS, thereby making MRPS a valu-
able tool for EV researchers.

However, experiments that involve EVs phenotyp-
ing are time consuming, due to 12 h- or overnight
incubations. In order to get accurate results, max-
imizing binding efficiency is a necessity; that nor-
mally
involves
ensuring
the
saturation
of
the
capture reaction, which can result in an unnecessa-
rily long incubation time. With the ability of label-
free kinetic binding measurements using interfero-
metric reflectance sensing in a microfluidic cham-
ber, we perform an optimization of the incubation
time in different flow conditions, while demonstrat-
ing a new way of multiplexing for real-time EVs
specific capture and detection.
Methods: All the real-time binding measurements were
performed
with
the
Interferometric
Reflectance
Imaging Sensor (IRIS). IRIS chips were first coated
with an organic polymer (MCP-2), which provides an
active surface for probe immobilization. Then, antibo-
dies against CD9, CD81, CD63 markers were spotted at
different densities in a microarray modality. The chips
were then encapsulated with a glass window to form a
microfluidic chamber that allows for imaging the sen-
sor surface.
Samples of HEK-derived extracellular vesicles were
flowed across the sensor surface in the IRIS system and
real-time images were acquired. Incubation was per-
formed at different flow rates, and in static and stop-
flow modalities.
Results: In this work, we focus on the specific capture
of EVs under different flow conditions to achieve an
optimization of the incubation time. Indeed, through
the acquisition of real time binding data, we are able to
precisely monitor the equilibrium point of the capture
reaction. In this configuration of IRIS, low magnifica-
tion optics allow for simultaneous detection of binding
on hundreds of capture ligand spots. Therefore, surface
probes (surface density and specificity) as well as assay
conditions can be optimized. We report on the opti-
mization of antibodies against CD9, CD81, and CD63
markers. Since the sensor chips are identical to the
single-particle
detection
assays
developed
by
Nanoview Biosciences, the optimization of binding
assays will directly impact the phenotyping of indivi-
dual exosomes.
Summary/Conclusion: Our method proved to be very
efficient in optimizing the most crucial aspects con-
cerning EVs capture – flow conditions, incubation
time, surface density and sample concentration.

Introduction: Diabetes is a life treating diseases
extending its impairing influence on more than 500
billion of people around the world within upcoming
20 years. The most harmful complication generating
high treatment and social costs is diabetic nephropathy,
which develops in about 10% of patients suffering
diabetes. Still we do not have an effective and direct
prognostic biomarker to diagnose renal complications
in the primary stage of renal disease.
Methods: Extracellular vesicles were concentrated from
diabetic patients’ urine and washed to perform spectral
analysis: Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR), based on the molecular absorption of electro-
magnetic radiation in the infrared region of the spec-
trum in a range from 400 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1 and
Raman spectroscopy (RS) as a technique based on
inelastic scattering of monochromatic light. Both tech-
niques provide information on the chemical structure
of compounds by identifying functional groups with
high molecular specificity.
Results: Average spectral signature obtained for EVs
from urine samples of patients in the different stage of
kidney damage allowed distinguishing specific bands,
representative for Amide (I/II), lipids, cholesterol and
nucleic acids. Spectral parameters correlated with a
clinical stage and a commonly used indicator of renal
function (creatinine) in diabetic patients.
Summary/Conclusion: Infrared and Raman spectro-
scopy are promising tools to diagnose and monitor
renal function in diabetes.

Introduction: Several existing bioanalytical strategies
for
purifying
and
characterizing
exosomes
have
allowed
for
fundamental
progress
to
be
made.
Mixtures of EVs can be enriched for exosomes by
techniques such as ultracentrifugation and size-exclu-
sion chromatography. But, these processes require
large amounts of material that are often difficult to
obtain and many different types of particles have simi-
lar sizes and densities. It is likely that unique subfrac-
tions within enriched samples exist, particularly in
complex biological matrices such as blood, urine or
milk which remain difficult to characterize and isolate
with existing analytical technologies.
Methods: Bovine milk exosomes were isolated via
differential ultracentrifugation and resolubilized in
100
mM
ammonium
acetate.
These
data
were
recorded using charge detection mass spectrometry
(CDMS). In CDMS, individual particles are reflected
back and forth through an electrostatic ion trap where
they pass through a sensitive charge detector. Each
time a trapped particle enters and exits the detector,
its charge (z) and mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio is mea-
sured. Mass distributions are generated by multiply-
ing the m/z values by the charge measured for each
ion and binning the resulting masses.
Results: The masses of particles in a bovine milk extra-
cellular vesicle (EV) preparation enriched for exosomes
were directly determined for the first time by CDMS.
Particle masses and charges span a wide range from
m ~ 2 to ~90 MDa and z ~ 50 to ~1300 e and are
highly dependent upon the conditions used to extract
and isolate the EVs. In total, 57,350 particles were
detected from eight CDMS measurements. A simple
two-dimensional Gaussian model suggests that eight
unique subpopulations of particles may be resolvable
based on charge and mass. Complementary EM and
proteomics analyses confirm that samples are enriched
for exosomes. Particles associated with the S1, S2, and
S3 families that are centred at ~ 3.5, ~5.9, and ~8.3
MDa, respectively, appear too small to be ascribed to
exosomes.
The
remaining
45,229
(79%)
particles
detected by CDMS are within the mass range expected
for exosomes. While CDMS measurements are at an
early stage of development, this approach appears to
provide a new physical basis for separating and char-
acterizing EV particles.
Summary/Conclusion: This work describes a novel
biophysical approach for measuring and characterizing
the masses and charges of the extremely heterogenous
population of exosomes and other extracellular parti-
cles enriched in bovine milk. As new sample prepara-
tion methods, aimed at purifying specific types of
exosomes from different cell lines, tissues, and other
body fluids continue to evolve, rapid and sensitive
CDMS measurements of the physical properties of
mass and charge may become an important means of
assessing the efficacy of different protocols.

Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common cause
of cancer-associated death in women and has raised
global health concerns. Early diagnosis and treatment
are crucial to improve the prognosis and survival rate
of breast cancer patients. Liquid biopsy is expected to
provide a strategy for early diagnosis of breast cancer.
Exosomes have been regarded as novel liquid biopsy
biomarkers due to their stable cargo of RNAs, lipids,
and proteins from their origin cells. Exosomal micro
(mi)RNAs have recently been recognized as promising
indicators
of
cancer
occurrence
and
progression.
However, most of the reported exosomal miRNA
detection methods require the lysis or extraction pro-
cess, which increases the possibility of sample loss. In
situ detection strategies avoid interference from body
fluid. In this study, we developed a gold nanomotor
fluorescence platform based on liposome fusion for
breast cancer exosomal miRNA in situ detection.
Methods: The exosomal miRNA detection platform
was constructed using a gold nanomotor (detector)
and liposomes (carrier). The DNAzyme amplification
sequences which could be especially triggered by
miRNA-10b were identified by SDS-PAGE before
modified on gold nano-motor and the capacity of the
nanomotor
was
assessed
using
synthetic
target
sequence, breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231, miRNA-
10b-encapsulated anionic liposomes, and miRNA-
10b-expressing exosomes. Three kinds of liposomes
were synthesized, characterized, and assessed for load-
ing ability. Membrane fusion effect was evaluated by
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and nano-
flow cytometry. The performance of this method to
discriminate
between
breast
cancer
patients
and
healthy individuals was investigated.

Results:
The
chosen
DNAzyme
amplification
sequences transformed “locked” status to “cleavable”
status on target addition, releasing a fluorescence sig-
nal. The modified gold nanomotor showed a ten times
higher fluorescence signal in the presence of miRNA-
10b than the background and no noticeable fluores-
cence changes from a single-base-mismatch sequence.
Moreover, among the three different liposomes, catio-
nic liposomes exhibited great stability, high loading
efficiency,
and
excellent
membrane
fusion
effect.
Furthermore, the fluorescent experiments confirmed
that cationic liposomes could load and transfer the
nanomotors into exosomes for miRNA-10b detection.
Finally, we were able to distinguish breast cancer
patients and healthy individuals by sensing exosomal
miRNA-10b directly from plasma samples without exo-
some isolation.
Summary/Conclusion: A separation-free and sensitive
assay based on DNAzyme amplification technique and
membrane fusion effect was established for breast can-
cer-derived exosomal miRNA-10b detection, which
could be a promising tool for the liquid biopsy of
breast cancer.

Introduction: Exosome-based liquid biopsy is a poten-
tial aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer
patients. However, in order to incorporate exosomes
into clinical routine, there is a need to compare differ-
ent isolation methods. Here we analysed the impact, in
exosomal RNA yield, of two intermediate recovery/
intermediate specificity methods: differential ultracen-
trifugation (UCD) and a membrane-affinity column
(MAC) kit. Although MAC has a faster performance
which is more suitable to the clinic, we found that
UCD results in a higher recovery of exosomes and
less contaminating non-exosomal RNA.
Methods: Exosomes were enriched by MAC and UCD
from identical volumes of human plasma (12,000xg,
34 min/0.22 )m filtration/110,000xg, 5 h)(n = 7) and
lymphoma conditioned medium(300xg, 10 min/200xg,
20 min/1000xg, 30 min/120,000xg 1.5 h/120,000xg, 1 h)
(n = 3). All exosomes were characterized by nanopar-
ticle tracking analysis (NTA), immunoblotting of
CD63/CD9/Flotilin/Alix
and
electron
microscopy
(TEM). Exosome pellets were pre-treated with protei-
nase K (1 mg/ml/56°C/10 min) and RNAse A (2 mg/
ml/37°C/20 min) before phenol-chloroform/glycogen
RNA extraction. RNA yield was measured by both
fluorometer and bioanalyzer.
Results: Isolation of exosomes by UCD, in both plasma
and medium, resulted in a higher yield in comparison
to MAC. This was shown by an augmented intensity of
marker bands in the UCD samples (p = 0.005, n = 4) as
well as by an increased number of exosomes in TEM.
In contrast, MAC final exosomal fraction (from both
plasma and medium), resulted in a 13-fold and 200-
fold increase in RNA, respectively, in comparison to
UCD when measured by fluorometer. This was con-
firmed by bioanalyzer. To further investigate if the
isolated RNA was inside exosomes, MAC and UCD
final exosomal fractions were treated with enzymes
before RNA extraction. Importantly, no significant
effect was observed in RNA yield.
Summary/Conclusion: Together this data shows that
MAC isolates fewer exosomal structures than UCD;
however, it shows a greater recovery of total RNA
thus suggesting that non-exosomal RNA is getting
trapped by MAC. The fact that RNA showed resistance
to RNAse A cleavage might result in the inclusion of
contaminating RNA into the sample.

Introduction: The visualisation of extracellular vesicles
(EV) via fluorescent means presents a promising
method of characterisation. There is potential to speci-
fically label individual EV families in order to distin-
guish them in samples of multiple EV subgroups.
Nevertheless, fluorescent EV labelling has proven diffi-
cult. Nanosight NTA© is the standard for visualising
EV and does possess means of fluorescence capture.
Methods: This method utilised a cell division probe
consisting of 5-(and 6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and anhydrous DMSO,
forming a non-specific long-lasting fluorescent probe
typically used for in vivo cell tracking that is interna-
lised

tracker at a concentration of 10uM, before cells were
incubated in serum free media at 21% or 1% oxygen,
respectively. This fluorescence was visualised using a
488 nm fluorescent Nanosight© NTA laser under light
scatter and fluorescent means of capture.
Results: The use of a CFSE Cell Tracker Probe proved
that EVs were able to take up the probe from their
parent cells. EVs from the cells with the tracker probe
internalised, also contained the probe and exhibited
fluorescence.The probe was long enough lasting to be
identified on Nanosight and has shown promise with
no significant difference in EV number when com-
pared to light scatter.
Summary/Conclusion: Identifying a potentially cost
effective method for visualising EV and combating
photo-bleaching, the cell tracker proves that the tech-
nique works on a functional level. Further investigation
is needed to determine if this can be used to specifically
label and identify individual EV families in a popula-
tion. This could allow for the numbers of individual EV
families to be shown in a given sample.

Collection, Gaithersburg, USA
Introduction: There is a need for better techniques for
characterizing EV populations. We developed a sensi-
tive
multiplexed
electrochemiluminescence
(ECL)-
based assay format to characterize EVs in cell-condi-
tioned medium (CCM) and human biofluids. Here we
use the format to analyse EV samples for the presence
of 66 EV surface proteins, and to identify changes in
EV phenotype associated with different cell lines, pur-
ification methods and growth conditions.
Methods: Multiplex plates were prepared on MSD’s U-
PLEX® platform with antibodies for 66 putative EV-
surface proteins. Each well displayed an array of nine
specific capture antibodies and a negative control anti-
body. EVs from samples were captured on the arrays
and then detected with a cocktail of anti-tetraspanin
antibodies (CD9, CD63 and CD81) conjugated to an
ECL label. Three distinct cell types were grown at two
sites, MSD and ATCC. Resulting CCM were each pur-
ified
by
four
common
methods:
tangential
flow
filtration,
PEG-based
precipitation,
size-exclusion
chromatography and centrifugal ultrafiltration. All
samples were also assayed without purification.
Results: Fifty-five of the surface markers were detected
on intact EVs from at least one evaluated cell type.
Datasets were analysed using correlation matrices, hier-
archical clustering, and machine learning. For each cell
type, when comparing unpurified CCM grown at dif-
ferent sites or EVs prepared by different purification
methods, we typically observed correlations above 0.9,
indicating that the purification methods did not intro-
duce bias to EV phenotypes, and that the assay format
can provide robust phenotypic information without
any purification of EVs. Two unsupervised clustering
analyses – hierarchical clustering and t-distributed sto-
chastic neighbour embedding – both generated well-
separated clusters for each of the cell types, regardless
of purification method or source.
Summary/Conclusion: We developed multiplex EV
surface marker assays and demonstrated their use for
multimarker EV phenotyping. This flexible format
enables rapid assay development for new EV subpopu-
lations with or without sample purification. These
results also demonstrate EV surface marker phenotyp-
ing via multiplex ECL assays may be used to distin-
guish EV populations from various cell types, and
characterize bias introduced by purification.

western blotting protocols. Here we present a simple

method for isolation of EVs and a simple western
blotting platform for automated protein separation
and
immunodetection
of
MISEV-recommended
proteins.
Methods: Total EVs were isolated by affinity-mem-
brane spin columns from pre-filtered 0.5–4 mL plasma
or 2–20 mL urine, respectively. Intact vesicles were
eluted and the EV-depleted biofluid fraction was col-
lected from the flow-through. A small fraction (4 μL)
was analysed by a simple western blot workflow pro-
viding automated capillary electrophoresis-based pro-
tein separation and immunodetection, characterizing
each fraction for presence or absence of MISEV-
recommended proteins.
Results: A range of specific antibodies were identified
and the EV fractions were shown to be enriched in EV-
proteins, whereas contaminating non-EV proteins were
significantly reduced. Isolation of EVs was necessary to
allow detection of the low abundant EV protein mar-
kers, whereas non-EV proteins were readily detectable
both in the neat biofluids and in the EV-depleted flow-
through. We characterized the effect of washing on the
purity of EV isolates and defined the dynamic range of
the workflow using titrations of input volume of both
plasma and urine EV isolations.
Summary/Conclusion: Simple western blotting proto-
cols were established for quality control of isolated EVs
in accordance with MISEV-guidelines. EVs isolated
using affinity-membrane spin columns were shown to
be enriched in EV markers and depleted for non-EV
proteins.

Introduction: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-
associated deaths and early detection could lead to
improved
patient
outcomes.
Extracellular
vesicles
(EVs) are readily accessible from patient bio-fluids
and could be a source of early-stage lung cancer bio-
markers. Recent studies indicate that EVs contain
metalloproteinases.
The
matrix
metalloproteinases
(MMPs),
a
disintegrin
and
metalloproteinase
(ADAMs) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase
with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs) are highly
promising cancer biomarker candidates that have com-
plex roles in cancer pathogenesis and metastasis.
Importantly, within the context of lung cancer, the
detection of ADAM10 proteolytic activity might be
more informative than the level of ADAM10 protein.
Therefore, the development of low-cost metalloprotei-
nase biosensors could serve as useful biomarker
research tools.
Methods: To this end, we developed Advanced
proteoLytic detector PolyHydroxyAlkanoates (AL-
PHA) beads – a library of biodegradable, biopoly-
mer-based protease biosensors. Broadly, these bio-
sensors utilise PhaC-reporter fusion proteins that
are bound to microbially manufactured bioplastic
beads. These PhaC-fusions also incorporate specific
protease cleavage sites. In the presence of a specific
protease, reporter proteins are cleaved off of the AL-
PHA beads – resulting in a loss of bead fluorescence
that can be measured using flow cytometry. These
biosensors were assayed using either metalloprotei-
nases, conditioned media or EVs from in vitro can-
cer models.
Results: Human metalloproteinase recognition motifs
were identified in the literature and a total of 70 dif-
ferent AL-PHA bead biosensors were designed. A con-
trol, TEV-specific biosensor detected 0.5 U of tobacco
etch virus protease activity and the MMP14 biosensor
successfully
detected
0.033
mU
of
recombinant
MMP14 activity. A panel of AL-PHA biosensors also
detected an array of MMP, ADAM and ADAMTS
proteases within cell conditioned media and isolated
EV samples from in vitro cancer models.
Summary/Conclusion: AL-PHA biosensors success-
fully detected EV-associated metalloproteinases and in
the longer-term, we envision that AL-PHA beads may
lead to the development of low-cost cancer diagnostics
for use in resource-limited settings.

Program to assess the rigour and reproducibility of extracellular vesicle-
derived analytes for cancer detection
Matthew Young and Sudhir Srivastava
National Cancer Institute, Rockville, USA
Introduction: Cancer cells release more EVs than nor-
mal cells and EVs secreted from tumour cells can
promote tumour progression, survival, invasion and
angiogenesis. The EV cargo may mirror the altered
molecular state of the cell of origin. Therefore, EVs
have potential for the development of non-invasive
markers for early detection of cancers. EVs and their
cargo also have the potential to be multiplexed with
other molecular markers or screening modalities (e.g.,
imaging) to develop integrated molecular-based com-
putational tools for the early detection of cancer.
One challenge with using EVs as a biomarker is the
lack of robust and reproducible methods for the isolation
of a pure vesicular population. There is a lack of clear
consensus for an optimal method of isolation of a pure
EV population that is devoid of contamination with
similar-sized vesicles of different origins. There is also a
lack of standards to ensure rigour reproducibility.
Methods: The current funding opportunity announce-
ment (FOA), PAR20-053, is promoting research on the
isolation and characterization of extracellular vesicles
(EVs) and their cargo for the discovery of biomarkers
to predict cancer and cancer risk.
Results: The previous cycle of this FOA, PAR16-267/
277, successfully funded 7 R01 and 4 R21 grants. These
awards are focused on proteomics profiling of EVs,
effect of methodological and biological variability,
asymmetric-flow field-flow technology, therapeutic
monitoring, LSS and SERS lab on a chip optical spec-
troscopic, EVs in obesity-driven hepatocellular carci-
noma,
nanoscale
structure
and
bio-molecular
heterogeneity, urinary EV DNA, and EV markers in
paediatric cancers.
Progress from these awardees have shown separa-
tion of two discernible exosome subpopulations and
identified a distinct nanoparticle, the exomere (Nature
Cell Biology, 2018); and have shown that large-EVs
contain the entire genome of the cell of origin, includ-
ing cancer-specific genomic alterations (Journal of
Extracellular Vesicles, 2019). Protocols that critically
evaluate and refine the existing methodologies to
improve utilization of EVs in clinical use have been
shared (Nature Protocols, 2019).
Summary/Conclusion: Drs. Sudhir Srivastava and
Matthew Young are the programme directors for the
PAR which began accepting applications on 5 January

Introduction: Brain extracellular vesicles (EVs) are
heterogenous and include previously described micro-
vesicles and exosomes. Herein we characterized a for-
merly
unappreciated
population
of
mitochondria-
derived
EVs
that
we
term
“mitovesicles”.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-established hall-
mark of ageing and neurodegenerative disorders as
Down syndrome (DS). Hence, we examined mitovesi-
cle levels and cargo under these conditions to charac-
terize in vivo mitovesicle biology and responsiveness to
mitochondrial stressors.
Methods: Employing a high-resolution density gradi-
ent, distinct and novel populations of EVs were isolated
from murine and human DS and diploid control post-
mortem brains or from cell media. Morphometric EV
features were analysed by nanoparticle tracking analy-
sis and cryogenic electron microscopy, while EV con-
stituents were characterized by Western blotting, mass
spectrometry, lipid profiling and mitochondrial RNA
qPCR.
Results: We identified a population of double-mem-
brane, electron-dense brain EVs containing multiple
mitochondrial markers (“mitovesicles”) that are highly
distinct from microvesicles and exosomes. Proteomic
data show that mitovesicles contain a unique subset of
mitochondrial proteins while lacking others, such as
Tom20. Mitovesicles have a lipid composition that is
unlike
that
of
previously
described
EVs
and
is
consistent with mitochondrial origin. Functionally,
the complex-III inhibitor antimycin-A stimulated in
vitro mitovesicle release into the cell media, suggesting
an interrelationship between mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion and mitovesicle biology. In mouse brains, mitove-
sicle levels increased with age and were found to be
higher
in
DS
compared
to
diploid
controls.
Mitochondrial RNA and protein levels were also
altered in DS compared to diploid controls.
Summary/Conclusion: We describe a previously uni-
dentified type of metabolically competent EVs of mito-
chondrial origin that we designate mitovesicles. Our
data demonstrate that brain mitovesicle levels and
cargo are tightly regulated in normal conditions and
are modified during pathophysiological processes in
which mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, suggesting
that mitovesicles are a previously unrecognized player
in mitochondria quality control and may have a role in
the trans-cellular tissue response to oxidative stress.

Introduction: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastat-
ing neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive
memory loss and ultimately death with limited thera-
peutic options. Growing evidence supports the theory
that toxic proteins, like tau and amyloid, may propa-
gate from diseased cells by packaging toxic proteins
into extracellular vesicles (EVs) and releasing them to
infect
other
cells.

biogenesis of EVs is neutral sphingomyelinase 2
(nSMase2), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingo-
myelin to produce phosphorylcholine and ceramide.
Several groups have reported improved cognition and
reduced tau propagation when nSMase2 is pharmaco-
logically inhibited or genetically knocked down in AD
mouse models. Unfortunately, current nSMase2 inhi-
bitors are not suitable for clinical development due to
poor
solubility
and
inadequate
pharmacokinetic
profiles.
Methods: Our group carried out a high-throughput
screening campaign followed by extensive medicinal
chemistry efforts leading to the discovery of phenyl

carbamate
(PDDC), an orally active, nM potent inhibitor with
excellent selectivity and brain penetration. We tested
PDDC’s ability to inhibit exosome release in cultured
primary glial cells as well as an in vivo model of acute
EV release. We then treated 5XFAD mice with 10 mg/
kg of PDDC daily for six months and monitored their
behaviour in the fear conditioning assay.
Results: PDDC dose dependently reduced EV release
from cultured primary glial cells and significantly
reduced plasma EV numbers in an in vivo model.
Following chronic treatment with PDDC, 5XFAD
mice demonstrated significantly improved cognitive
function in the fear conditioning assay.
Summary/Conclusion: These promising findings are
currently being expanded using mouse models of tau
propagation. If successful, these data would support
PDDC as a novel compound for targeting the patholo-
gical spread of tau as a therapeutic for AD.

Introduction: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is
one of the leading causes of disability worldwide,
affecting 20% of the population. The environment has
been thought to play a role in the disease development,
resulting in biological changes mediated by epigenetic
mechanisms. MicroRNA’s (miRNA) are well known
epigenetic
regulators
that
are
disrupted
in
the
depressed brain, and they are packaged into extracel-
lular vesicles (EVs). EVs have emerged as means of
intercellular communication, a process that is also dis-
rupted in MDD. They are thought to transfer miRNA
between cells, which can alter gene expression in reci-
pient cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that EV cargo is
altered in MDD subjects compared to healthy controls
(HC). The aim is to extract EVs from human post-
mortem anterior cingulate cortex, a region previously
associated with depression, and profile the miRNA
cargo and compare it between MDD subjects and HC.
Methods: Post-mortem human brain tissue from the ante-
rior cingulate cortex of 20 MDD subjects and 20 HC was
mildly dissociated in the presence of collagenase type III.
Residual tissue, cells, and large vesicles were eliminated,
and EVs were isolated using size exclusion chromatogra-
phy. The quality was assessed by western blots and trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM). RNA was extracted
and a small-RNA library was constructed and sequenced
using the Illumina Platform. Differential expression analy-
sis was then performed.
Results: Western blots showed little to no Endoplasmic
Reticulum (Calnexin), Golgi (BiP), or mitochondrial
(VDAC) contamination, along with enrichment of the
exosomal marker CD9. TEM images showed the typical
cup-shaped morphology with sizes mostly between 30
and 200 nm. Preliminary sequencing results revealed
that miR-33a-5p, which is predicted to target glutamate
receptors,
is
downregulated
in
EVs
from
MDD
subjects.
Summary/Conclusion: High quality EV extractions
can be obtained from post-mortem brain tissue using
our method. This will be the first study to profile brain-
derived EV miRNA in the context of depression.
Future studies will be needed to determine the effect
of the different levels of miR-33a-5p. This could pro-
vide novel mechanistic insights into the pathophysiol-
ogy of MDD and will serve as a starting point to
examine the potential role of EVs in MDD pathology.

Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is charac-
terized by diverse primary mechanisms of injury that
lead to the development of secondary pathological cas-
cades that drive neurological deficit post-TBI. Inability
to separate patients based on the presence of these
different endophenotypes represents a major challenge
for diagnosis and treatment of TBI.
Extracellular vesicles including exosomes isolated
from patient plasma have emerged as promising poten-
tial biomarkers for TBI due to their ability to cross the
BBB into systemic circulation with molecular cargo
intact for analysis. We have developed a novel micro-
fluidic platform for rapid isolation of brain-derived
EVs providing a tool with which the biochemical
state of neurons and glia can be directly assessed
post-TBI. We used the ultra-sensitive, single molecule
array (SIMOA) to quantify concentrations of 7 protein
biomarkers from the plasma and brain derived EVs
from mild TBI patients and controls. By combining
multiple protein biomarkers, we could discriminate
mTBI patients from controls in both the training and
the blinded test set.
Building on this work, we are also characterizing
single EV heterogeneity of neuron derived EVs by
developing novel droplet based digital assay for single
EV quantification at ultra-low concentration. Droplet
based assay for single EV analysis would potentially be
very informative for early disease diagnosis and therapy
decision.
Methods: Our microfluidic platform for EV isolation
consists of tracked-etched membranes with millions of
nanopores (600 nm), coated with a magnetic film
(NiFe)
to
precisely
capture
immunomagnetically
labelled brain-specific EVs from plasma. Single mole-
cule array (SIMOA) was used to quantify concentra-
tions of the 7 protein biomarkers (Tau, UCHL-1, NFL,
GFAP, IL6, IL10, and TNF) in the plasma and brain-
derived exosomes of mild TBI (mTBI) patients and
controls. To identify single EV, we applied droplet
based
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
and
encoded the fluorescent signal for single EV quantifi-
cation within parallelized microfluidic platform.
Results: We report that concentrations of plasma and
exosome GFAP, NFL, and UCHL1 were elevated in
mTBI patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and
that each of these biomarkers are uncorrelated with
one another. Discrimination of mTBI patients from
controls was most accurate when machine learning
algorithms on the panel of biomarkers. Specifically,
combining plasma NFL, GFAP, IL6 and TNF- with
Tau from GluR2+ EVs showed 88% accuracy with
80% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
Summary/Conclusion: This data suggests that neuron-
derived exosomes contain information that charac-
terizes the injured and recovering brain. It also suggests
that analysis of a panel of biomarkers from a combina-
tion of both blood and exosomal compartments could
lead to more accurate diagnosis of mTBIs.

L1CAM is not associated with extracellular vesicles in cerebrospinal fluid
or plasma
Maia Norman, Dmitry Ter-Ovanesyan, Wendy Trieu and David Walt
Wyss Institute, Boston, USA
Introduction: Neurons in living psychiatric and neu-
rological patients are inaccessible for cell type specific
analysis of RNA and protein. Our understanding of
these diseases instead relies upon imperfect sources of
biochemical information such as post-mortem brain
tissue analysis and animal models. Furthermore, there
is a paucity of biochemical assays available to diagnose
and manage brain diseases. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
present an opportunity to noninvasively sample the
contents of neurons in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
plasma.
In
order
to
isolate
neuron-derived
EVs
(NDEVs), a cell type specific transmembrane protein
is necessary for immunocapture. L1CAM, a protein
abundant on the surface of neurons, has been used
extensively in the literature for NDEV isolation.
However, L1CAM exists in humans in several isoforms
without a transmembrane domain, and as such it can
be secreted as a free protein. Additionally, the ectodo-
main of L1CAM can be cleaved off of the cell surface in
physiological processes. It remains to be demonstrated
whether the L1CAM found in CSF and plasma is EV
associated, or if it is instead a spliced or cleaved iso-
form behaving as a free protein.
Methods: Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), a
digital form of ELISA, as well as Western blotting, we
quantify EV markers (CD9, CD63 and CD81) as well as
L1CAM and Albumin. We use these assays to deter-
mine in which fractions of size exclusion chromatogra-
phy (SEC) and density gradient the L1CAM appears.
We also immunocapture L1CAM from CSF and
plasma and perform Western blots for the internal
and external domains of L1CAM.
Results: Simoa and Western blot analysis of SEC and
density gradient fractions demonstrated that while the
EV markers peaked all together, L1CAM eluted in the
free protein fractions along with Albumin in both CSF
and
plasma.

forms of L1CAM in CSF and plasma.
Summary/Conclusion: Our data utilize a multitude of
distinct techniques that converge to demonstrate that
L1CAM is not associated with EVs in CSF or plasma.
Furthermore, our data suggest that the isoforms pre-
sent in CSF and plasma are distinct, which indicates
that the L1CAM in plasma is likely not coming from
the brain. This data call into question the utility of
L1CAM as a NDEV marker and point to the need to
find novel candidates for immunoprecipitation of
NDEVs.

Introduction: In Parkinson’s disease (PD), α-synuclein
(α-Syn) aggregates known as Lewy bodies (LB) are
present in both the central and peripheral nervous
system. Furthermore, data showing that α-Syn can
spread from PD patients to transplanted tissue has led
to a new theory postulating that pathological forms of
α-Syn can drive disease by “infecting” healthy cells and
corrupting normal proteins. The exact routes and
mechanisms involved in such spreading are yet to be
fully understood but it is known that α-Syn can be
secreted from cells and transported via extracellular
vesicles (EV). EV derived from erythrocytes (EEV)
are of particular interest in this regard as they have
been shown to contain α-Syn.
Methods: We first optimized a protocol for the isola-
tion of fluorescently labelled human EEV. The capacity
of these EEV to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
was then evaluated in vitro using a Boyden chamber
composed of primary human brain endothelial cells.
Next, EEV were added to a more complex and physio-
logically relevant 3D human BBB model including
iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. In
both in vitro protocols, flow cytometry was performed
on media collect from each compartment to determine
the number of EEV. Immunofluorescence was per-
formed to assess the localization of fluorophore tagged
EEV. We are also using an in vivo paradigm for the
extraction and testing of EEV spread and an in situ
cerebral perfusion (ISBP) model in WT mice to inves-
tigate if and how EEV cross the BBB using confocal
microscopy.
Results: In both in vitro models, flow cytometry ana-
lyses showed that fluorescently tagged EEV added to
the luminal side traversed the endothelial cell barrier.
Confocal analysis revealed that some EEV could also be
found within endothelial cells themselves. Ongoing
experiments are being conducted in our newly devel-
oped 3D BBB to further confirm these results. Our
preliminary in vivo experiments showed that fluores-
cently labelled beads, similar in size to EEV, used in the
ISBP experiments are detectable in the brain parench-
yma of injected WT mice using confocal microscopy.
Preliminary work also includes ISBP injections of EEV
in 6-month-old WT mice, (n = 6/groups) derived from
PD patients (at different stage of the disease) and a
healthy individual as a control.
Summary/Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggests
that EEV can indeed move across the BBB in both in
vitro and in vivo experimental setups. Ongoing experi-
ments will determine the dynamics and processes
involved in this transport and whether EEV can pre-
cipitate and/or exacerbate disease-related features.

Introduction: Neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of
childhood cancer mortality. Amplification of the
oncogene N-Myc is a well-established poor prognostic
marker for neuroblastoma. Whilst N-Myc amplifica-
tion status strongly correlates with higher tumour
aggression and resistance to treatment, the role of
N-Myc in the aggressiveness of the disease is poorly
understood. Exosomes are released by many cell types
including cancer cells and are implicated as key med-
iators in cell-cell communication via the transfer of

Methods: In this study, comparative proteomic analy-
sis, nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission elec-
tron microscopy, RNAi-based knockdown, migration
and cellular survivability assays were performed to
understand the role of exosomes isolated from cells
with varying N-Myc amplification status.
Results: Label-free quantitative proteomic profiling
revealed 968 proteins that are differentially abundant
in exosomes released by the N-Myc amplified and non-
amplified neuroblastoma cells. Gene ontology-based
analysis
highlighted
the
enrichment
of
proteins
involved in cell communication and signal transduc-
tion in N-Myc amplified exosomes. Treatment of less
aggressive SH-SY5Y cells with N-Myc amplified SK-N-
BE2 cell-derived exosomes increased the migratory
potential, colony forming abilities and conferred resis-
tance to doxorubicin induced apoptosis. Incubation of
exosomes from N-Myc knocked down SK-N-BE2 cells
abolished the transfer of resistance to doxorubicin
induced apoptosis.
Summary/Conclusion: These findings suggest that
exosomes could play a pivotal role in N-Myc-driven
aggressive neuroblastoma and transfer of chemoresis-

Introduction: Quantification and characterization of sin-
gle extracellular vesicles (sEVs) based on surface markers
can aid in dissecting the heterogeneous landscape of EV
subpopulations. We and others have demonstrated the
potential of imaging flow cytometry (IFC) to perform
sEV characterization. We recently showed release of pro-
toporphyrin (PpIX) positive sEVs by 5-aminolevulinic acid
(5-ALA) dosed glioma cells, in vitro and in vivo. Rickfels et
al. also used IFC to demonstrate the enrichment of CD63
+/CD81+ EVs in the plasma of glioma patients. Herein, we
performed in vitro studies to characterize EV subfractions
using 5-ALA as well as EV and CNS specific surface
markers.
Methods: We use IFC to characterize EVs released by
glioma using 5-ALA, fluorescently labelled EV (CFDA-
SE, CD81) and glioma specific (tenascin C and epider-
mal growth factor receptor vIII, EGFRvIII) markers.
Furthermore,
we
characterized
EVs
released
by
EGFRvIII positive glioma cells treated with dexametha-
sone, a steroid commonly used in glioma patients, to
determine the effect of steroids on EV release. EVs
were quantified by IFC and results were confirmed by
qPCR for the levels of EGFRvIII mRNA.
Results: Firstly, we optimized protocols to label glioma
sEVs using fluorescently labelled EV markers (CFDA-
SE, CD81) and tumour specific markers (tenascin C
and EGFRvIII). Of the total EVs (CFDA-SE), we
demonstrate that 58% are tenascin C positive, 2.7%
are EGFRvIII positive and 1.6% are 5-ALA positive.
There was only a minor overlap (<16%) between the
sub-populations. Finally, we show that dexamethasone
treated glioma cells release lower total EVs (2.5-fold),
tumour specific EVs (2.8-fold; EGFRvIII), EGFRvIII
mRNA compared to mock treated cells.
Summary/Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential
of IFC to monitor sEVs released by glioma cells
exposed to different stimuli. This allows the character-
ization of EV sub-populations providing a working
model to understand the dynamics of tumour EVs at
a single vesicle level.

100–300 nm and have morphology similar to EVs
reported for other fungi. We performed label-free quan-
titative proteomics to describe the protein cargo of EVs
from Fgr and Fov, including a comparative study of EVs
from Fov grown on different media: Czapek Dox (CD)
and Saboraud’s Dextrose Broth (SDB).
Results: A total of 658 proteins were detected in Fgr
EVs and, according to prediction software EffectorP,
12.5% of these were potential effectors. Similarly, 70%
of EV proteins do not contain signal peptide indicating
that packaging into EVs is a novel mechanism of secre-
tion for these proteins. Notable Fgr EV proteins
include lipases, proteases and synthases for toxins and
chitin. Fov produced EVs in similar quantities in both
growth media tested, but EV protein cargo differed
between them. There was a 39% overlap in proteins
identified in the 465 CD and the 658 SBD EV proteins.
In general, EV proteins were involved in metabolism,
cell wall architecture and oxidoreduction, with 15.4%
and
12.9%
of
potential
effectors,
respectively.
Polyketide and toxin synthases, proteases and effectors
were present in both types of Fov EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: This new fungal EV isolation
method was rapid, yielded high-quality EVs, and did
not submit particles to high centrifugal forces. Our
data revealed that both Fgr and Fov produce EVs
enriched with proteins that could alter host immune
responses or facilitate fungal infection. Furthermore,
the protein composition of Fov EVs was dependant
on culture conditions. This supports a potential role
for fungal EVs in disease progression in plants and
provides the foundations to pursue the role of EVs in
plant-fungal interactions with the potential to identify
new targets for disease control.

Introduction: Extracellular Vesicles (EV) released by
infective forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of
Chagas’ disease, modulate inflammatory response of
macrophages through the activation of Toll 2 receptor
(TLR2) via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
This induces the production of nitric oxide (NO) and
expression of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-6,
which could explain the inflammation observed in
experimental Chagas’ disease, and eventually in the
progression of human disease. EVs released by the
parasite are heterogeneous and it is unknown which
factor, or factors present in the different vesicle popu-
lations act during the interaction with host cells.
Objectives. The goal of the present work was to char-
acterize and isolate the different populations of EVs
released
by
T.
cruzi
and
test
their
effects
on
macrophages.
Methods: EV released by trypomastigotes forms of T.
cruzi (Y strain) were purified by Asymmetric flow
field-flow fractionation (AF4) and characterized by
Nanoparticles tracking analysis (NTA). The different
populations of EVs were incubated with host human
monocytes cells (THP-1) and cytokines production
determined by ELISA and qPCR. The different EV
populations
were
also
incubated
with
LLCMK-2
epithelial
cells
and
the
infection
by
T.
cruzi
determined.
Results: We found two distinct populations of EVs. A
population with 50 to 50 nm (EV1) and another with
100 to 120 nm (EV2). EV1 induced more TNF-alpha,
IL-6, IP-10 and CCL20 than EV2. It was also more
effective in promoting T. cruzi infection in epithelial
cells.
Summary/Conclusion: T. cruzi released two EV popu-
lations that affects differently host cells. Identification
of these EVs composition might help to better under-
stand the role of EVs in the modulation of T. cruzi
infection.

due to unknown reasons, making these systems insuffi-
cient for use in drug development and infectivity assays.
Noroviruses are known to attach to gram-negative
enteric bacteria and this facilitates infection in vitro.
However, the microbiome- norovirus-host communica-
tion link is missing. Noroviruses infect immune cells
present in lamina propria during acute infection, but
bacteria themselves are large enough to cross the mucosal
and the tight epithelial barrier which separates gut lumen
from lamina propria. We hypothesized that binding of
noroviruses to bacteria enhances extracellular vesicles
(EV) production. Because commensal bacterial EVs by
themselves do not have any detrimental effects on host
cells, we believe using EVs in in vitro culture will enhance
norovirus infection, thus producing higher titre of viruses
for vaccine and anti-viral drug development.
Methods: Attachment assay: Purified norovirus was
incubated with Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus
acidophilus and Bacteroides thethiotaomicron, and
grown to produce EVs. The attachment was confirmed
via qPCR.
Isolation of EVs: Clarified media supernatants were
subjected to ultracentrifugation at varying speeds and
0.2um filtration. Co-purification of norovirus with the
EVs was checked.
EV quantification and characterization: EV total pro-
tein content was measured by microBCA. The number of
vesicles were quantified by Nanoparticle tracking analy-
sis. Scanning and Transmission electron microscopy was
performed to check quality of EV preparation and deter-
mine if virus was attached to the vesicles. Internal EV
protein content was evaluated using MS-HPLC. The EVs
were also check for infectivity via TCID50 assay.
Results: Incubation of noroviruses with commensal bac-
teria resulted in significant increases in production of EVs
compared to uninfected controls. Murine norovirus
(MNV), used as a surrogate, was found to be associated
with EVs. EM analysis determine association of viruses
with the bacteria as well as the MVs, while also showing
certain surface structural changes in virus attached bac-
teria compared to mock bacteria. The EVs were found to
cause infection in naive macrophages.
Summary/Conclusion: Changes in EV production and
content by bacteria exposed to noroviruses will provide
insight into its pathogenesis and possible solutions to
the low viral output from HuNoV culture systems.

Hospital, Washington, USA
Introduction: Bacteria constitutively produce biologi-
cally active extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain
RNA, DNA, and/or proteins. Bacteria use these EVs for
communication with other bacteria and recent research
suggests bacterial EVs can also affect host cells. Given
these findings, it is necessary to examine the role of
bacterial EVs in human disease. Current methods of
bacterial EV isolation from human specimens cannot
distinguish between bacterial species. However, there is
utility in examining EVs from specific species, as bacterial
species and their EVs may have unique contributions to
human disease. Our objective was to isolate circulating
EVs specifically from Escherichia coli (EEVs) and
Haemophilus influenzae (HEVs), two known colonizers
and pathogens in the gut and airway, respectively.
Methods: Total EVs were isolated from the blood of six
healthy volunteers via precipitation and size exclusion
chromatography. EVs were then selected via a novel
latex bead-based fluorescent antibody construct targeting
species-specific outer membrane proteins. We used flow
cytometry to evaluate the isolated EVs.
Results: The constructs were saturated with EEVs at an
antibody concentration of 11.5 µg/mL of plasma, as geo-
metric means ≥11.5 µg/mL were nearly equal. HEVs were
detected at 48 µg/mL of plasma, but saturation is yet to be
determined. EEVs were imaged by a FEI Talos F200X
electron microscope and measured between 40–90 nm,
and HEVs were between 60–160 nm. Both types of EVs
were spherical.
Summary/Conclusion: Using this novel technique, we
were able to isolate, detect, and visualize EEVs and HEVs.
This technique enables the study of specific bacterial EVs.
In the future, EV contents will be assayed. Furthermore,
this technique will be modified so that specific bacterial
EVs from body fluids can be used for downstream func-
tional applications. This is the first time that bacterial EVs
from targeted bacterial species have been detected in
blood from healthy humans.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma exosomes modify the metabolism status of
human dendritic cells and favour their recruitment through the CCL20
chemokine

Introduction: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is
characterized by a large presence of regulatory T cells
(Tregs) and the production of tumour-derived exosomes
with immunosuppressive properties. Our team showed
that NPC-derived exosomes favour the suppressive activ-
ity and recruitment of human Tregs via CCL20 chemo-
kine, thus contributing to NPC immune escape (Mrizak
et al., JNCI, 2015). More recently, our team has shown
that NPC-exosomes could induce Tregs by altering the
maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and promoting tol-
erogenic dendritic cells (tDCs) (Renaud et al., HerPas
congress 2017). Our main objectives in this study are (i)
to define and compare the metabolic status of mature
dendritic cells (mDCs), control tDCs and tDCs generated
in the presence of NPC-exosomes (ExoCNPtDC) and (ii)
to evaluate the chemoattractive potential of NPC-exo-
somes on ExoCNPtDCs, and notably to investigate the
involvement of CCL20 in this recruitment.
Methods: DCs are generated from human monocytes
in the presence or absence of NPC-exosomes. The
maturation status of DCs was evaluated at a phenotypic
level by studying the expression of maturation markers
using flow cytometry and at a functional level by ana-
lysing cytokines secretion using ELISA. This cytokine
analyse has been performed in both conditions, on
treated DCs and during co-culture assays of autologous
CD3 T lymphocytes with treated DCs. In a second step,
a mitochondrial metabolic and glycolytic study was
performed using the Seahorse technology (OCR and
ECAR measurement). Finally, the chemoattractive
potential of NPC-derived exosomes on the different
induced DCs was analysed (i) using Boyden chamber
chemoattraction assays or real-time videomicroscopy
(Chemotaxis µSlide IBIDI) and (ii) using RT-qPCR
analysis of the receptor expression of CCL20 (CCR6).
Results: NPC-exosomes alter DC maturation, which
gives rise to tolerogenic DCs that favour the induction
of Tregs. In addition, the metabolic analysis of DCs
seems to put foward a specific metabolic signature of
the tDCs induced by NPC-exosomes. And finally, che-
moattraction assay suggests that NPC-exosomes pre-
ferentially attract tDCs and ExoCNPtDCs in a CCL20-
dependant manner.
Summary/Conclusion: Taken together our results
should allow us to characterize the major role of NPC
tumour exosomes on the maturation and the recruit-
ment of DC and so identify them as anti-tumoural
therapeutic targets.

Introduction: Recently, instead of ultracentrifugation,
development of new preparation protocol is demanded
for research of reliable bioactivity and drug discovery
of extracellular vesicles (EVs). In this study, we propose
a novel method for large scale preparation of high-
performance extracellular vesicles focusing on mem-
brane negative charge.
Methods: Murine cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) EVs
in supernatant were concentrated more than 20 times
at over 97% purity without leaking by 750 kDa MWCO
ultrafiltration, and subjected to ion exchange DEAE
column chromatography after replacing with PBS.
After ion exchange, EVs were characterized by BCA
assay, NTA assay, cryoTEM observation, proteome
analysis, DNA content measurement, miRNA micro-
array analysis, zeta potential measurement, lectin array
analysis, and target cell analysis.

Results: Murine CTL EVs were broadly divided into
two populations that were eluted at low salt (L-s:
0.15 M-0.3 M NaCl) and high salt (H-s: 0.3 M-0.5 M
NaCl) concentrations. L-s CTL EVs were abundant in
late endosome-related proteins, integrins, Rabs, and
effective miRNAs, indicating exosome characteristics,
and had biological activity for preventing tumour
metastasis after depletion of tumoural mesenchymal
cell populations by intratumoral administration (See
Seo et al., Nat. Commun. 9: 435, 2018). Contrary, H-s
CTL EVs were rich in DNA, core histones, ribosomal
proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, and housekeeping pro-
teins, considering microvesicles and apoptotic bodies,
and easily phagocytosed by a Kupffer cell line (KUP5:
Kitani et al., Results Immunol. 4: 68–74. 2014). In
addition, there were noticeable differences between L-
s and H-s CTL EVs in the negative zeta potential width
and membrane glycan structure.
Summary/Conclusion: Thus, ion exchange can be an
optimal mass fractionation method for discriminating
bioactive exosomes from cargos for nucleic acids
in EVs.

Introduction: Metastatic breast cancer is a conse-
quence of complex interactions between cancer cells
and the host. CLIC4, a member of a conserved gene
family in the glutathione-S-transferase superfamily,
mediates crosstalk between tumour and host in breast
cancer. TCGA and METABRIC data indicated that
elevated CLIC4 expression was associated with breast
cancers from young women, those with poor prog-
nosis, and those with early stage metastatic disease.
Methods: Since bulk tumour analysis does not distin-
guish between cancer and host stromal cells, we used
genetic modifications of established syngeneic breast
cancer mouse models to evaluate the contributions of
CLIC4 in the host or tumour cells to develop
metastases.
Results: Experimentally, the essential Clic4 host con-
tributions for metastatic competence were related to
circulating levels of pro-metastatic soluble factors,
neoangiogenesis, tumour cell attachment to lung tissue,
myofibroblast differentiation, and leukocyte migration.
CLIC4 was detected as cargo in circulating extracellular
vesicles (EVs) from breast cancer patients. Similarly,
circulating EVs from tumour-bearing mice have abun-
dant CLIC4 in comparison to those from mice bearing
tumours that lack CLIC4. Tumour cells released EVs
that induced myofibroblast conversion of wildtype but
not Clic4 ablated lung fibroblasts.
Summary/Conclusion: These results illuminate CLIC4
expression as a prognostic marker for breast cancer
patients, and experimentally, CLIC4 is a critical host
factor for metastatic competence and potential target
within host tissues for anti-metastatic therapy.

Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable
cancer of bone-marrow plasma cells. It is characterized
by
unpredictable
and
highly
variable
therapeutic
response and poor survival, attributed to the develop-
ment of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy.
Presently, no clinical procedures allow for a continu-
ous, minimally invasive monitoring of MDR. We iden-
tified unique extracellular vesicle (EV) populations in
the blood of myeloma patients, which serve as biomar-
kers of disease evolution and MDR to combination
chemotherapy. We describe approaches used to opti-
mise the use of flow cytometry (FCM) for EV

biomarker detection and analysis and detail strategies
for cross-platform analytical validation.
Methods: We conducted a cross-platform analysis
using two commercially available flow cytometers
designed for EV detection. Scatter resolution, enumera-
tion accuracy and precision were determined across
both platforms by analysing submicron silica beads
(ApogeeMix, 180–1300 nm) of known concentration.
We detected large EVs, as established by reference size
beads, electron microscopy, expression of phosphati-
dylserine and the presence of integral membrane pro-
teins of cell of origin. We analysed EVs isolated from
plasma by high-speed centrifugation (18,900 g) as well
performing analysis by direct plasma labelling followed
by validation by detergent lysis of vesicular constitu-
ents. A clinical operating range was defined which
ensures linearity and avoids swarm detection.
Results: We observed comparable scatter resolution,
enumeration accuracy (error ≤15%) and precision
(CV ≤5%) across both platforms used. We defined
two EV size gates: a “Latex” gate (300 to 1100 nm
polystyrene latex beads), and a “Silica” gate (180 to
1300 nm silica beads) for EVs at the lower end of our
size range of interest. To improve detection sensitivity,
we identified common contributors to signal noise and
applied workflow strategies to minimize these. Finally,
we identified linear ranges which avoid swarm detec-
tion, and which ensures reproducible EV counts (CV
<20%) across both instruments.
Summary/Conclusion: We present an optimised, stan-
dardised and cross-platform reproducible working pro-
tocol which supports the use of FCM in an EV-based
liquid biopsy application.

Introduction: Cancer radiotherapy (RT) induces the
response of the whole body that could be detected at the
blood level. Searching for new molecular signatures
which could correlate with treatment response in cancer
patients is of particular importance. Radiation-induced
changes in proteome and transcriptome of serum have
been widely described. However, metabolomic changes in
serum, exosomes and other classes of small extracellular
vesicles (EV) of cancer patients after RT have not been
given as much attention. Metabolomics of serum and EV
of cancer patients could provide a valuable insight into
the response of both tumour and whole organism to the
treatment. The aim of the study was to compare serum
and EV metabolomic profiles in head and neck cancer
(HNC) patients before and after RT.
Methods: Serum samples from 10 HNC patients were
taken before (A) and after (B) RT. 10 healthy volunteers
were used as a control group (C). EV were isolated from
1 ml of serum using size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC). Selected SEC fractions were subjected to extrac-
tion of metabolites. A mixture of MeOH/H2O was used
for extraction of metabolites from serum and EV samples.
Samples were analysed by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS).
The study protocol adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
Bioethical Committee of the Maria Skłodowska-Curie
National Research Institute of Oncology, Branch Gliwice,
Poland (permit nr. DO/DGP/493/4/06/1/2016/G).
Results:
An
untargeted
GC-MS-based
approach
allowed the detection of 189 metabolites in serum
samples and 50 exosomal small molecules, of which
32 joint. The identified compounds included amino
acids, fatty acids, carboxylic acids, sugars, and others.
There were 49 metabolites which levels discriminated
compared groups (A,B,C) of serum samples and 12
compounds that discriminate the EV isolated from
HNC serum before and after RT from HC.
Summary/Conclusion: RT caused significant changes
in levels of serum and EV metabolites witch are
involved in amino acid metabolism, lipids metabolism,
energy metabolism and oxidative stress response.

capable of contributing to intercellular communication
and metastasis. Numerous studies have focused on
elucidating their role in cancer progression. We
recently showed that sEVs isolated from pancreatic
cancer cells can function as an initiator in malignant
cell transformation. Here, using a mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomics approach, we analysed the dif-
ferences in the protein cargo of sEVs secreted from
normal pancreatic and cancer cells to better under-
stand their biological characteristics.
Methods: sEVs were isolated from 3 human pancrea-
tic cancer cell lines (Capan-2, MIA PaCa-2, and
Panc-1)
and
normal
pancreatic
epithelial
cells
(HPDE) using a combined ultrafiltration-ultracentri-
fugation method coupled with a sucrose density gra-
dient purification. Proteomic profiling of sEVs was
carried out using an LC-MS/MS method. Protein
identification from resulting MS/MS spectra was
conducted using proteome database search software
followed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and
Reactome pathway analysis.
Results: A total of 4,907 unique proteins were identi-
fied confidently across the combined samples. The
proteins present in all four sEV types (1,135 proteins)
consist of general housekeeping proteins. 348 proteins
were uniquely found in all cancer sEVs but not in the
normal HPDE sEVs. This group contains an enrich-
ment of proteins that function in the endosomal com-
partment of cells responsible for vesicle formation and
secretion and suggest their important role in driving
the increased production of sEVs from cancer cells
relative to normal cells. Moreover, this group includes
a set of proteins that have been implicated in malignant
cell transformation, consistent with our previous work
showing that each of the cancer sEVs analysed here
could initiate malignant transformation of NIH/3 T3
cells. Conversely, there were 313 proteins uniquely
found in normal HPDE sEVs. This group includes a
number of immune response proteins that are not
found in any of the pancreatic cancer cell sEVs.
Summary/Conclusion: The differences in the pro-
teomes of cancer and normal sEVs may be indicative
of their varying roles in cell transformation and helpful
in delineating the types of EVs that are being produced.
In addition, these differences point towards their
potential value as cancer biomarkers.

Introduction:
Exosomes
released
by
cancer
cells
referred to as “tumor-derived exosomes” (TEX) play a
key role in tumour-induced suppression of immune
effector cells and in the promotion of tumour growth
by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Molecular pro-
filing of extracellular vesicles circulating in human
body fluids, including plasma exosomes, is a promising
non-invasive strategy to identify cancer biomarkers.
However, specific targeting of TEX remains a real
challenge because there is no antigens specific for exo-
somes produced by cancer cells in general. Here we
took advantage of CSPG4 antigen frequently overex-
pressed in melanoma cells for the immunocapturing of
melanoma-derived exosomes (MTEX) present in the
plasma of melanoma patients and their separation
from
non-malignant
cell-derived
exosomes
(non-
MTEX) present in the specimen.
Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 15
patients
with
melanoma
treated
at
the
UPMC
Hillman
Cancer
Center
Melanoma
Program
Outpatient Clinic. Total exosomes were isolated by
the mini-SEC method. Fraction #4 containing the
majority of exosomes was separated into MTEX and
non-MTEX fractions using the immunoaffinity capture
method with biotin-labelled anti-CSPG4 mAb. The full
MS/data-dependent acquisition was performed with
the use of the Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nanoLC
system connected to the Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass
spectrometer.
Results: An untargeted MS/data-dependent approach
allowed the detection of about 650 proteins. Proteins
detected in the material from at least 8 patients were
considered, which resulted in 488 proteins included in
the analysis. To identify proteins enriched in MTEX,
the individual patient ratio between MTEX and non-
MTEX fraction was analysed for each protein. We
found 49 proteins specific/characteristic for MTEX.
These included several enzymes exemplified by riboso-
mal protein S6 kinase alpha-3, D-3-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase, phosphomannomutase 2, hypermethy-
lated in cancer 2 protein, acidic mammalian chitinase.
Moreover, among components enriched in the MTEX

Isolation and characterization of prostate-derived extracellular vesicles as
a liquid biopsy strategy in cancer diagnosis

Kölsch, Sabrina Rau and Dirk Kuhlmeier
Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI, Leipzig,
Germany
Introduction: In the past years, extracellular vesicles
(EVs) have attracted considerable interest due to their
ability to provide valuable diagnostic information from
liquid biopsies. The high abundance in all bodily fluids
and their cargo stability confers EVs the potential as a
powerful tool to not only obtain novel biomarkers
from inaccessible tissues, therapy response and mon-
itoring, but also to reduce infection risks of conven-
tional highly invasive biopsies.
Virtually all cells continuously release vesicles into
the extracellular environment, diverse in size, content
and features depending on the biogenesis, origin and
function. This heterogeneity adds a layer of complexity
when attempting to isolate and characterize tissue-spe-
cific vesicles.
Methods: Hence, we aimed to use a immunomag-
netic capture approach for prostate-derived EVs
from cell culture supernatants, with further investi-
gation
into
human
plasma
and
urine
samples.
Analysis was performed by nanoparticle tracking
analysis, western blotting and electron microscopy.
Additionally, an in-house spotted antibody microar-
ray is in development. Here, we intend to detect
different EV sub-populations based on their surface
markers.
Results: Isolated immunocaptured EV populations
based on the classical EV marker CD9 show an
increased signal for the luminal protein TSG101. EV
populations targeting the tissue-specific marker pros-
tate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), were found
positive for TSG101 in a lower extent indicating a sub-
population of EVs. The microarray uses less than
100 µL of sample (concentrated cell culture superna-
tant, human plasma, urine) and leads to a faster char-
acterization within 3 h for EV surface marker as
compared to western blot.
Summary/Conclusion:
Immunomagnetic
isolation
might be a promising approach for liquid biopsy and
thereby the microarray could be valuable to identify
potential capture targets. The current design for 6
different surface marker from 16 samples simulta-
neously could be easily extended for sample size and
surface profiling allowing for a more economical way
to multiplex samples.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EV) in urine have
been proposed as biomarkers for bladder cancer (BC).
However, at present there are no standardized methods
for EV isolation or urine sampling. Our goal was to
evaluate the EV isolation performance between differ-
ent methods, the effect of the sampling time and the
importance of urinary creatinine (UCr) normalization.
Methods: Two urine samples of 120 mL were collected
from 5 patients with non muscle-invasive BC: one from
the first micturition and another from any time of the
day. Twenty mL were used for UCr measurement and

the highest protein expression of exosomal proteins.
UF alone showed the highest concentration of EV,
but with a tendency to isolate larger particles. Particle
concentration was positively correlated with UCr,

Summary/Conclusion: UF + SEC gave the highest EV
yield and was not affected by the time of urine collec-
tion. The use of PI and DTT can be avoided, and
normalization to UCr should be considered when
implementing this technique for assessing EVs as bio-

Introduction: Human tumours, including pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), often harbour a sub-
population of cancer cells with extra centrosomes. We
found, that these cells secrete an increased number of
small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), within the 20–
120 nm size range. SEVs play a role in cancer signalling
and progression and are widely studied for their diag-
nostic potential. We aim to understand the role of sEVs
secreted by cells with extra centrosomes in shaping
PDAC-associated stroma, particularly fibrosis.
Methods: To study the sEV mediated changes in the
PDAC microenvironment, we purified sEVs through
serial
ultracentrifugation
and
Size
Exclusion
Chromatography, characterised the content through
SILAC-based proteomics, and assessed phenotypic
changes in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) production through immuno-
fluorescence staining.
Results: Our data indicates, that the sEVs secreted by
cells with extra centrosomes are exosomes due to their
endocytic origin, and we found, that they can activate
PSCs, key mediators of fibrosis in PDAC. Indeed, we
observed an increased level of collagen I produced by
PSCs activated by sEVs from cells with extra centro-
somes as compared to cells without extra centrosomes.
Interestingly, we found, that PSC activation through
sEVs is not mediated by TGF-β, assessed by the level
of nuclear SMAD2 accumulation downstream of TGF-
β activation, suggesting a novel mechanism of PSCs
activation.
Summary/Conclusion: PDAC cells with extra centro-
somes
contribute
to
a
novel
type
of
PSC
reprogramming, which could alter their ECM deposi-
tion and contribute to the extensive fibrosis observed
in PDAC. We are currently characterising the signal-
ling pathways associated with sEV mediated PSC acti-
vation and how it impacts PADC progression to better
understand the role of centrosome amplification in the
cancer-stromal crosstalk.

Introduction: Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) is asso-
ciated with growth and metastasis of liver, pancrea-
tic and colorectal cancers. Here, we examined if
exosome-based CPE plays a role in promoting
malignant properties of liver hepatocellular carci-
noma (HCC) cells, and if CPE-shRNA loaded exo-
somes can be used to target growth and invasion of
HCC cells.
Methods: Exosomes were isolated from the culture
media of high metastic HCC97 H cells and incubated
with low metastatic HCC97 L cells. In other experi-
ments, CPE-shNA loaded exosomes from HEK293cells
were incubated with HCC97 H cells. The recipient cells
were analysed for proliferation using MTT assay, col-
ony formation, and Matrigel invasion.
Results:
Analysis
of
exosomes
derived
from
HCC97 H cells revealed CPE-WT mRNA and pro-
tein. Exosomes released from HCC97 H cells were
able
to
enhance
proliferation
and
invasion
of
HCC97 L cells. When CPE expression was sup-
pressed in the HCC97 H cells before exosome isola-
tion, the exosomes had no effect on proliferation and
invasion. These data demonstrate the ability of exo-
somes to confer growth and invasion in HCC cells
and the role of exosomal CPE in driving the process.
Previously it was shown that down-regulation of CPE
expression by shRNA can reverse tumour growth
and metastasis in an HCC mouse model. We there-
fore loaded CPE-shRNA into exosomes by infecting
HEK293 (Human Embryonic Kidney) cells with ade-
novirus carrying CPE-shRNA-GFP. These modified

exosomes were used to transfer CPE-shRNA to
HCC97 H cells, resulting in significant reduction in
proliferation and colony-forming ability of these
cells. CPE-shRNA loaded exosomes were found to
down-regulate the expression of Cyclin D1 and c-

growth and metastasis.
Summary/Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the
ability of exosomal CPE to enhance proliferation
and invasion in low metastatic HCC cells and the
potential to use shRNA loaded exosomes to target
CPE as a therapeutic strategy to treat liver cancer.

Stress hormones promote prostate cancer aggressiveness through modula-
tion of mir-628-5p expression and exosome release
Leslimar Rios-Colon, Elena Arthur and Deepak Kumar
North Carolina Central University, Durham, USA
Introduction: Despite proactive screening and steady
declines in mortality, prostate cancer (PCa) remains
one of the most prevalent cancers among men.
Evidence suggests that chronic activation of stress
signalling
pathways
can
result
in
an
altered
miRNAs transcriptome and affect exosomal content
and release. Here, we study the interaction between
leptin and miR-628-5p expression, previously shown
to be downregulated in PCa patients. In addition,
explored the effect of stress hormones cortisol and
leptin on exosomal release and content from PCa
cells.
Methods: We utilized normal prostate cell line RWPE-1,
and
PCa
cells
PC3,
LNCaP
and
MDA-PCa-2b.
Proliferation of cells treated with leptin in the presence
or absence of miR-628-5p mimic or negative control was
assessed by MTT, colony formation, wound healing, and
expression of targets affected by miR-628-5p was assessed
by western blotting. Moreover, exosomes were isolated
via differential centrifugation from PCa cells treated with
leptin or cortisol and exosome number was determined
by Nanotracking Analysis. Exosome content was deter-
mined by western blotting and proteomic analysis by
mass spectrometry.
Results:
We
observed
that
leptin
significantly
decreased expression of miR-628-5p in RWPE-1 cells.
Co-treatment with miR-628-5p mimic and leptin abro-
gated these effects in a cell dependent manner. We also
observed that co-treatment with leptin affected miR-
628-5p target JAG1 and other molecules involved in
epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In parallel, we
demonstrated that cortisol increases exosome secretion
particularly in PC3 cell exosomes with a 2.6-fold
increase at 5 nM Cortisol compared to untreated.
Western blotting revealed the presence of GR in exo-
somes particularly at 5 nM Cortisol.
Summary/Conclusion: Understanding epigenetic reg-
ulation through miRNAs and exosomes may be the key
to understand stress hormone influence in PCa pro-
gression. These findings suggest that stress hormones
effectively affect miR-628-5p expression and exosomal
release and signalling.

Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising
drug
delivery
vehicles
for
therapeutic
microRNA
(miRNA). For the loading of exogenous cargo, research-
ers broadly seek to either manipulate the EVs directly or
the cell that produce them. Electroporation, sonication,
and direct EV transfection are common methods that
work by physical disruption or irreversible chemical addi-
tion, which may irreparably damage the molecules
intended for therapy. On the other hand, transfection
into the producer cells is a simple option that does not
imperil EV integrity.
Methods: There are multiple factors that contribute to
EV loading efficiency, including transfection reagent
used, timing, and dosage. Thus, we sought to establish
a basic protocol and improve understanding of the
underlying dynamics involved in a basic system con-
sisting of HEK293 T cells and miR-146a-5p mimic.
Results: In this work, we examined how different
reagents lead to variable EV loading. Then we looked
at
variable
dosages,
specifically
the
relationship
between RNA amount added to reagent, amount pre-
sent in cell, and amount exported to EVs.
Summary/Conclusion: These results will help future
studies produce EVs with exogenously loaded small
RNA, and suggest future optimizations.

Introduction: xtracellular vesicles (EVs), secretory
vesicles of 30–100 nm size from cells, are carriers of
proteins and miRNAs. Despite a variety of EV isolation
tools, it is still challenging to separate individual EVs.
We report a single EV trapping method via aptamer-
mediated assembly between Au nanoparticle (AuNP)
and Au superlattice template. We propose a chip-based
EV
trapping
technique
based
on
semiconductor
processes.
Methods: We introduce aptamer coated Au nanopar-
ticle (AuNP) and Au superlattices as a template to
capture EVs. First, we fabricated poly(methyl metha-
crylate) (PMMA) hole pattern on Au-coated Si sub-
strates by using electron beam lithography (EBL). We
designed 200 nm-diameter hole patterns to capture one
EV in each hole. To connect the AuNP and the Au
superlattice template, we used an aptamer molecule as
a linker strand. Also, to capture individual EVs, the
aptamer molecule is designed to have a hairpin struc-
ture to specifically bind to CD63, a protein marker of
EV. We modified 5ʹ-terminal and 3ʹ-terminal of the
CD63 aptamer with thiol group for the formation of
self-assembly monolayer (SAM) on both AuNP and Au
superlattice surface.
Results: First, we coat the CD63 aptamer on the sur-
face of AuNP. Afterwards, we load the aptamer-coated
AuNP into Au superlattice template. EV solution is
specifically bound to CD63 aptamer. After washing
step, each EV is expected to locate within a single
hole due to the size confinement of the hole. To sepa-
rate the EVs from the aptamer, we use restriction
enzyme, BamHI, to recognize specific DNA sequence
and cleave them.
Summary/Conclusion: In this report, we propose a
AuNP -linked Au superlattice chip by aptamer mole-
cules for trapping EVs. We selected CD63 aptamer for
specifically binding with CD63 in EVs. In addition, we
designed CD63 aptamer as a linker strand to connect

Introduction: A hallmark of platelet activation is the
release of internal granules as extracellular vesicles/
microparticles. ThromboLUX is a dynamic-light-scat-
tering-based (DLS) instrument that was developed for
use in clinical setting to check for platelet activation
before transfusion. Compared to traditional DLS, the
ThromboLUX requires no cleaning (single-use capil-
lary) and requires very little sample (70 µL). Hence the
ThromboLUX may be a useful instrument beyond pla-
telet pack test in blood transfusion laboratory. We have
evaluated its use as an in-process monitoring tool for
industrial EV manufacturing, for both quantifying cells
(input) and EVs (output).
Methods: The ThromboLUX was used to test the activa-
tion status of expired platelet packs (donated by ARCBS
for research purpose). The readout was compared with
platelet swirling test and flow cytometry data (surface
marker). Furthermore, the ThromboLUX was also tested
for process development and EV manufacturing moni-
toring purposes at different stages of the process for its
ability to rapidly obtain particle presence and size infor-
mation on EVs. Time to result was also compared
between different particle analysis methods.
Results: The ThromboLUX was a better predictor of
platelet packs variability compared to the traditional
platelet swirling method. However, we did not observe
a strong correlation between the activation status and
the flow cytometry-based activation marker data. The
ThromboLUX was able to provide a useful estimation
of particle presence and sizing of EVs in-process.
Results are obtained rapidly, within minutes, with
minimal sample prep.
Summary/Conclusion: Although we did not observe
a
significant
direct
correlation
between
flow
cytometry activation data and the % microparticles
(within a small sample size), the ThromboLUX has
shown potential to become a useful tool for in-pro-
cess monitoring for EV manufacturing and other EV
research, in particular through its speed and ease
of use.

Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been
widely used in both clinical and pre-clinical trials as an
alternative teraphy for degenerative diseases1. The thera-
peutic effect of MSC derived through paracrine effects that
secreted protein as signalling molecules that support the
process of cell and tissue regeneration3. Secreted proteins
from MSC can be different depends on source of the cells,
such as umbilical cord, adipose, dental pulp, and other
potential sources. Therefore, it is considered quite impor-
tant to know the better source of MSC to produce the
protein that can be used for cell and tissue regeneration.
Methods: This study compared the total protein pro-
duced by MSC from umbilical cord and adipose tissue
from various passages. MSC were cultured using
growth medium until reach 70–80% of confluency.
Afterwards, growth medium were replace with serum
free media for 24–48 haours to harvest the secreted
protein.
Results: Total protein produced by adipose-derived
MSC is ranged from 55.7–188.2 μg/ml, it is higher
compared to the total protein from umbilical cord-
derived MSC which ranged from 55.1–141.2 μg/ml.
Total protein produced by MSC is increased along
with the passage in both sources of MSC. MSC release
signalling molecules for cells communication, where in
vitro condition it can be found in their culture med-
ium. Protein expression from the culture medium is
increased along with the passage of the cells. This is
related to the process of cell maturation, where the
more mature cells become more active to metabolize
and secrete proteins. Adipose-derived MSC secreted a

Introduction:
A
major
manufacturing
challenge
related to exosome bioprocessing is that of robust and
scalable purification. As efforts to translate exosomes
into clinics grows, the more important the design of
quality systems which can reproducibly purify the pro-
duct becomes. The current gold-standard, ultracentri-
fugation, was adopted from the viral vaccine industry,
but remains imperfect in terms of scale up and manu-
facturing due to labour and time intensive process
requirements. In order to follow the preferential adop-
tion of more standard bioprocesses, as previously
achieved by the viral vaccine industry, we show the
development of two monolith chromatography steps
which can be used to purify exosomes from a clinically
relevant, allogeneic stem cell product (CTX0E03).
Methods: T-flask expansion of CTX0E03 cells was per-
formed to yield batches of 5–15 L of conditioned med-
ium. The medium was subsequently clarified by bench-
top centrifugation, and concentrated into a crude con-
centrate by tangential flow filtration [TFF], using a
combination of 0.22 µm dead-end filtration prior to
concentration in a 300kDa hollow-fibre TFF system.
TFF retentate was loaded onto 1 mL HIC or AEx
monoliths,
for
further
purification.
Potency
was
assessed by a fibroblast wound healing assay in vitro.
Results: Exosome presence was verified in the TFF
material by detection of CD 81 and CD 63. Exosomes
recovered in this manner could achieve full wound
closure in vitro over 72 hours, when dosed at 20 µg.
Further
purification
by
monolith
chromatography
showed high levels of reduction of albumin, detected
by western blot, as well as heightened ratios of particles
to both total protein, and total DNA. The results indi-
cate that neither AEx nor HIC steps cause detrimental
loss to product function, either alone or in combina-
tion with one another.
Summary/Conclusion: Monolith chromatography can
achieve scalable and reproducible purification of stem
cell derived exosomes, whilst maintaining their func-
tional capacity.

Introduction: To clarify the roles of extracellular vesicles
(EV) in vivo, it is important to visualize and track EVs
from the source cells to their destination. However, since
most EV reporters are also present in the releasing cell, it
is challenging to visualize EVs in vivo.
Methods: To tackle these problems, we developed a
degradation-based technique to remove background
fluorescence. We use degradation motifs called degrons
to target proteins for ubiquitination and degradation in
the cytosol, while leaving EVs labelled. We re-purposed
an endogenous zinc finger (ZF1) degron in the nema-
tode model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, but show
that the technique can also be applied to mammalian
cells with the auxin-inducible degron (AID). To speci-
fically label MVs in C. elegans, we ZF1-tagged the
PI4,5P2-binding PH domain of the cytosolic phospho-
lipase PLC1∂1, which is primarily found at the plasma
membrane.
Results: The ZF1-tagged plasma membrane reporter is
released in MVs outside the cell and remains fluores-
cent because intervening membranes hinder the pro-
teasomal degradation of the ZF1 reporter in MVs. In
the end, MVs maintain fluorescence, while the reporter
is removed from inside the source cell. This increased
the visibility of MVs from the neighbouring cells,
enabling the visualization of MVs with a normal light
microscope. Using this ubiquitous plasma membrane
reporter, we could visualize released MVs during C.
elegans embryogenesis, which helped us to identify
new MV release inhibitors. Additionally, we show
that this technique can be used to determine MV
cargo in vivo.
Summary/Conclusion:
Ultimately,
our
approach
boosts the visualization and tracking of EVs in vivo.

bThe London DNA Foundry,
Imperial College London, London, UK
Introduction: Extracellular vesicles (EVs), are emer-
ging as a potentially powerful new class of multi-
modal
therapeutics
and
drug
delivery
vehicles.
However, challenges remain – EVs are highly hetero-
geneous and differ in terms of their biogenesis, size
(~30-1000 nm) and complex molecular compositions
(lipid bilayers, ncRNAs, proteins and small molecules).
Furthermore, EVs exist within complex cell secretomes
and body fluids. Thus, navigating EV heterogeneity
through the use of robust isolation and characterisation
methods (metrology) is beneficial to several research
applications – including, therapeutic EV manufactur-
ing. To this end, we isolated and characterised batches
of HEK293 EVs that were harvested from a hollow
fibre bioreactor.
Methods: HEK293 cells are an industrially important
mammalian cell line that have been previously used to
manufacture
therapeutic
antibodies
and
EVs.
To
prepare EV batches, HEK293 cells were cultured for
30 days within a hollow fibre bioreactor that was con-
figured with a 20 kDa cartridge to concentrate HEK293
cells (up to ~10e9 cells) and their secretomes (>20 kDa
proteins and EVs) within ~20 ml harvest volumes. EVs
were isolated, for comparative purposes, using ultra-
centrifugation (UC), tangential flow filtration (TFF)
and
immunocapture
(IC)-based
methods.
Isolated
EVs were characterised using DLS, high-throughput
NTA, dot blot array and partially using nanoflow cyto-
metry, ExoView and TRPS.
Results: EV batches harvested at different intervals
were
characterised.
EV/particle
sizes
(NTA):
UC
140 ± 10.7 nm, TFF 134 ± 13.3 nm and IC
126 ± 3.9 nm. EV/particle concentrations (NTA): UC
17 ± 25x10e11/ml, TFF 0.2 ± 0.1x10e11/ml and IC
49
±
35x10e11/ml).
Total
protein
(Qubit):
UC
0.8 ± 0.6 mg/ml, TFF 0.2 ± 0.2 mg/ml and IC
4 ± 0.6 mg/ml. EV batch diversity is likely due to a
number of interacting factors including changes in cell
density, cell growth rate and EV isolation or character-
isation methodology.
Summary/Conclusion: EV heterogeneity varies across
different EV batches and must be carefully monitored
and assessed in terms of any potential impacts on
scalable EV manufacturing.

Introduction: Renal resistance to insulin’s action could
be an independent risk for chronic kidney disease
(CKD) and diabetes. The existing methods to estimate
kidney – specific insulin resistance in humans are not
feasible for clinical and epidemiological studies or use
in routine clinical practice. Blunted action of insulin on
insulin-responsive genes in the kidneys, such as
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), could
be an important indicator for impaired kidney-specific
insulin sensitivity.
Methods: PEPCK, Glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
and Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) were esti-
mated in kidney-derived exosomes in human urine
(UE). Fold mRNA expression were estimated using
qRT-PCR and related to fasting serum insulin levels.
Proteins were estimated by ELISA and normalized to
urine creatinine. Urinary exosomal protein after over-
night fast and at 2 hours of oral glucose tolerance test
(2 h-OGTT, postprandial) was compared. Subjects
were categorized based on HOMA-IR values for the
analysis. In vivo and in vitro models with PEPCK
induction was used to study PEPCK regulation in
kidney and in kidney-derived exosomes.
Results: Human UE had detectable protein and mRNA
levels of PEPCK, FBPase and G6Pase, with FBPase
having the highest abundance. Fasting insulin levels
strongly predicted PEPCK mRNA levels in human
UE. Also, Pepck protein in UE showed a significant
suppression in the fed state, relative to the fasted state.
HOMA-IR values significantly predicted the expression
of the three Gng enzymes in uE from the fed state.
Subgroup analysis showed blunted Pepck suppression
in subjects with lower insulin sensitivity relative to
subjects with better insulin sensitivity respectively.
Immuno-blotting showed significantly higher PEPCK
protein band-density for PEPCK protein in UE from
pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects relative to non-dia-
betic controls. Renal PEPCK induction in rat using
short-term acidosis, or in human proximal tubule
(hPT) by glucocorticoid stimulation, resulted in higher
PEPCK levels in rat UE and hPT-derived exosomes,
respectively.
Summary/Conclusion:
The
urine-based
approach
would ease regular screening of kidney-specific insulin
sensitivity in humans.

(PPL) and Heat-treated PPL (HPPL) exert strong neu-
roprotective effects of neurotoxin-exposed dopaminer-
gic LUHMES neuronal cell culture. This effect is
significantly enhanced using HPPL, which was also
highly protective of TH-expressing neurons in mice
Parkinson’s disease (PD) model. The role of their EVs
in neuroprotection is unclear. Our NanoBioAnalytical
(NBA) platform can help to characterize platelet EVs
phenotype, size, and morphology, and unveil the influ-
ence to neuroprotective functions of platelet lysates.
Methods: PPL and HPPL have been prepared by
freeze-thaw lysis of purified platelets. HPPL underwent
an additional treatment at 56°C for 30 min. Proteins
were analysed by Western blot (WB). HPPL neuropro-
tective function was studied by cell viability assays of

and size of EVs were evaluated in solution by several
complementary approaches. In the multiscale NBA
system, EVs were captured onto specific antibodies
grafted on the biochip, quantified by Surface Plasmon
Resonance imaging (SPRi) and then studied in situ by
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to unveil EVs
subsets.
Results: WB revealed higher expression of CD9, CD41
and CD61 markers in PPL versus HPPL. HPPL exerted
increased viability of erastin-exposed LUHMES cells
compared to PPL. EVs concentration was in the order
of 10e11/mL. SPRi results were consistent with WB,
with higher capture PPL EVs on aCD9, aCD41, and
aCD61 immunoarrays compared to HPPL. Evidence of
EVs was confirmed by AFM that revealed spherical
EVs and dimensions of the objects captured on spots.
The density of EVs was consistent with the differential
capture in SPRi.
Summary/Conclusion: HPPL exerts superior neuropro-
tection in in vitro and in vivo PD models. Our work
confirms the presence of EVs in HPPL and PPL, suggest-
ing the applicability of NBA platform for complex sample
analysis. CD41 and CD61 markers seemed affected by
PPL heat treatment. NBA platform can be valuable in
identification of the role played by EVs in the beneficial
neuroprotective effects of HPPL that can be exerted by
the EVs cargo (growth factors, mRNA, miRNA). The
proteomic and genomic contents of EVs present in both
platelet lysates remains to be studied.

Philadelphia, USA; cAgeX Therapeutics Inc., Alameda, USA
Introduction: There is a critical unmet medical need for
new therapies to treat age-related diseases including car-
diovascular diseases such as stroke. Exosome derived
from stem cells have shown intrinsic therapeutic potential
in a variety of animal models of ischaemic diseases. We
have identified scalable exosome production cell lines
(PureStem) as a source of angiogenic exosomes and are
aiming to generate good manufacturing practice (GMP)
grade therapeutic exosomes that can effectively mediate
angiogenesis and tissue regeneration.
Methods: We are developing exosome production and
purification
protocols
that
combine
methods
of
Tangential filtration flow (TFF) and size exclusion
chromatography (SEC). The particle number and size
were measured by both tunable resistive pulse sensing
(TRPS) as well as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
for comparison. Exosomes were characterized by detec-
tion of exosome surface markers and absence of cellu-
lar markers. Purity was assessed by measuring particles
per ug of total protein content. The angiogenic activity
of PureStem-exosomes was assessed using live-cell ima-
ging to measure endothelial wound-healing and tube
formation assays. We further investigated the molecu-
lar cargo of PureStem-exosomes by screening miRNAs
targets, RNA-seq analysis, and mass spectrometry
analysis.
Results: The isolated PureStem-exosomes using our
developed protocols were highly purified, resulting
purity in the range of 1E10-5E10 particles/ug. We
selected
angiogenic
exosome-producing
cell
lines
from our PureStem library by screening for func-
tional activity and characterizing their molecular
cargo. We found that PureStem progenitor-derived
exosomes showed higher angiogenic potency than
primary mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exo-
somes. Furthermore, angiogenic microRNAs such as
miR-126 were enriched in PureStem-exosomes from
certain producer cell lines.
Summary/Conclusion: These data demonstrate the
potential for using PureStem lines as a highly scalable
source of therapeutic exosomes. We were able to obtain
highly pure exosomes that retain their angiogenic
activity. We anticipate that PureStem-exosomes will
be a valuable resource for developing EV therapies for
stroke and other ischaemic diseases. We have devel-
oped purification methodologies aimed at achieving a
robust and scalable exosome production compatible
with GMP for clinical grade PureStem-exosomes.
These developments have great potential as therapeutic
agents for future preclinical in animal model of stroke
and clinical trials.

Introduction: The hallmark of Parkinson’s Disease
(PD) is a-synuclein accumulation, predominantly in
dopaminergic
neurons,
causing
neurodegeneration.
PD is also associated with insulin resistance, a condi-
tion characterized by phosphorylated insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS-1). Besides motor symptoms, some PD
patients develop Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-
MCI) or dementia (PD-D). Given the importance for
prognosis, there is an urgent need to develop biomar-
kers for distinguishing PD with normal cognition (PD-
N) from PD-MCI/D. Neuronal-origin Extracellular
vesicles (NEVs) contain cell signalling and pathogenic
proteins (including a-synuclein), which may serve as
biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease, PD and other
dementias.
Methods: From 0.5 ml of plasma from 104 PD-N, 83 PD-
MCI, and 39 PD-D patients, we immunocaptured NEVs
using anti-L1CAM antibody. Then, IRS-1pSer312 and
IRS-1pTyr20 and a-synuclein were measured in NEVs
using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.
Results: A-synuclein was lower in PD-MCI and PD-D
compared to PD-N (p < 0.005) and significantly
decreased with increasing motor symptom severity
measured by MDS-UPDRS III score (p = 0.005). IRS-
1pSer312 was lower in PD-D than in PD-N. IRS-
1pTyr20 significantly decreased with increasing MDS-
UPDRS III score (p < 0.005). No biomarker was asso-
ciated with disease duration.
Summary/Conclusion: PD patients with cognitive
impairment exhibited lower NEV levels of a-synuclein
than cognitively intact PD patients, whereas a-synu-
clein and IRS-1pTyr20 were inversely associated with
PD motor symptom severity. Additional biomarkers
and measurements will be available by the time of
ISEV. Plasma NEVs is a valuable tool for discovering
biomarkers in PD and investigating aspects of disease
progression.

Introduction: Despite decades-long advancement in
transplant medicine, there is a necessity for personalized
approach regarding early kidney allograft injury recogni-
tion and immunosuppression therapy towards improved
transplant outcomes. Biopsy, a gold standard for assess-
ment of kidney allograft injury, cannot be serially used for
the diagnosis of subclinical injury due to it’s invasiveness
and possible sampling errors. Instead, urine is easily
obtainable and bearing extracellular vesicles (EVs), poten-
tial carriers of pathological signals related to kidney injury.
Our aim was to set up a urinary EV (uEV) isolation
protocol that would allow consistent and reliable identifi-
cation of their characteristics and cargo.
Methods: Second morning urine sample (25 mL) was
collected from 7 patients and processed within 4 hours.
Oxalate precipitation, pH and dilution variability, uro-
modulin polymerization and high protein content were
taken into account. Isolated EVs were defined by
Transmission
Electron
Microscopy
(TEM)
and
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). uEV specific pro-
teins and miRNAs were analysed by Western blot and
qPCR, respectively.
Results: The optimal protocol relied on low speed urine
centrifugation (2.000 x g, RT) for cell removal and storage
at −80°C prior to further analyses. After urine thawing at
RT, added EDTA averted cryoprecipitate and uromodulin
polymer formation, while concentrated PBS neutralized
the pH. Filtration through 0.22 µm pores was used for
large particle removal, while centrifugal 100 kDa mem-
brane units (Amicon®, Milipore) served for sample con-
centration followed by particle separation on size-
exclusion chromatography (SEC; qEVoriginal, Izon Q).
Protein vacant SEC fractions (as rated at A280) were
pooled and concentrated to a volume of 70 µl. TEM
micrographs revealed high sample purity and cup-shaped
morphology of uEVs. As per NTA results, the average
mean size of EVs was 129,9 nm with concentration range
of 1 × 109 particles/mL of starting urine. uEVs were
positive for the tested marker proteins Hsc70, flotillin,
tubulin, GADPH and CD63. qPCR verified miRNA pre-
sence in uEVs, with CT for miR let-7i at 20.
Summary/Conclusion: We successfully isolated pure
uEVs. The set up protocol will be used to assess uEVs
as non-invasive biomarkers of allograft injury in kidney
transplant recipients.

Introduction: Recent advancements in the biology of
extracellular vesicles have begun to implicate glial
released microvesicles as mediators of glia to neuron
communication, suggesting that alterations in the
release and/or composition of astrocyte microvesicles
could impact neuronal function.
Methods: Astrocytes were allowed to constitutively
release extracellular vesicles (ADEV-CR), or stimulated
with ATP (ADEV-ATP). ADEVs were isolated by ultra-
centrifugation followed by proteomic analysis. We devel-
oped a normative whole transcriptome database using
primary neurons exposed to ADEV-CR, and identified
changes in neuronal gene expression produced by expo-
sure of neurons to ADEV-ATP. We identified a number
of pathways associated with the biological response of
synapse, spine and neurite outgrowth that were regulated
by ADEV-ATP.
The molecular cargo of ADEV-ATP responsible for
regulating synaptic functions in neurons were charac-
terized by biochemical, molecular, and functional
assays.
Results: ADEV-ATP enhanced the maturation of den-
dritic spines and produced functional enhancements in
neuronal
activity
and
network
connectivity.
The
mechanism for this effect involved the delivery of
Integrin-4 1 and EphA2 that were enriched in
ADEV-ATP.
Integrin-4
1
facilitated
binding
of
ADEVs to the neuronal surface, and EphA2-receptor
signalled through Ephrin to the tyrosine kinase ERBB2/
4 that regulated the phosphorylation and activation of
TrkB without increasing expression of the natural
ligands BDNF or NTF3. This direct activation of
TrkB increased the expression of the synaptic scaffold-
ing proteins Disc1, Arc, and Cplx3 to promote the
maturation of dendritic spines. This increase in mature
dendritic spines was associated with increased neuronal
activity and network connectivity demonstrating a
functional strengthening of synapses.
Summary/Conclusion: These data identify a molecu-
lar mechanism whereby modifications in ADEV pro-
tein cargo produced by the stimulation of astrocytes
with ATP regulates synaptic maturation through
activation of TrkB in a manner independent of
growth factors.

Enhancement of immunomodulatory functions of MSC-derived extracel-
lular vesicles through modification of up-stream parameters
Stephanie Kronstadt and Steven M. Jay
University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, USA
Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cell extracellular
vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been shown to have an
immunosuppressive effect in both autoimmune and
inflammatory disorders. Despite this, clinical transla-
tion of EV therapies is hindered by potentially low
potency in vivo and the lack of a scalable biomanu-
facturing process. Cell culture parameters are critical
in modulating both yield and bioactivity of EVs.
Thus, we hypothesized that the combination of che-
mical
priming
and
3D
dynamic
culture
would
enhance the yield and potency of immunosuppres-
sive MSC-EVs.
Methods: Bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured in
flasks were chemically primed using ethanol or curcu-
min. MSCs were also cultured using a 3D-printed
scaffold-perfusion bioreactor using a flow rate of
5 ml/min. Anti-inflammatory effects were assessed fol-
lowing application of MSC-EVs to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated
murine
macrophages.
Subsequent
inhibition of the production of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL-6, quantified using an ELISA, was used to
characterize EVs as anti-inflammatory. In addition,
both chemical priming and the bioreactor will be
simultaneously utilized to potentially uncover any
synergistic effects on EV immunomodulation abilities.
Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was used to
assess EV size and concentration while protein mass
was measured via a BCA assay.
Results: Preliminary data suggests that priming MSCs
with 100 µM ethanol for 24 hours prior to EV collec-
tion results in a strong inhibition of IL-6 production in
stimulated murine macrophages. NTA revealed that
MSC-EV yield increased by about two orders of mag-
nitude in the bioreactor (1.40E12 ± 7.92E10) when
compared with flasks (2.28E10 ± 2.81E9). Protein mea-
surements also indicated that EV production in the
bioreactor (~7600 µg) was much greater compared
with
production
in
the
flasks
(~2400
µg).
Additionally, average protein content per EV was
reduced
in
the
bioreactor
when
compared
with
flask EVs.

Summary/Conclusion: Although further investiga-
tion is required, our results potentially promise an
effective and inexpensive priming agent (i.e., ethanol)
for the production of anti-inflammatory MSC-EVs.
This, combined with the significant increase in yield
via 3D dynamic culture, presents practical solutions
to both EV manufacturing scalability and potency
issues.

Donor source affects potency of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracel-
lular vesicles
Daniel Levya and Steven M. Jayb
aUniversity of Maryland – College Park, Washington, USA; bUniversity of
Maryland, College Park, College Park, USA
Introduction: Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) thera-
pies have been heavily investigated for their utility in
applications such as wound healing and regenerative
medicine due to their angiogenic, immunomodulatory
and anti-apoptotic effects. Recently, MSC-derived
extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been implicated as
primary effectors in MSC-based therapies via protein
and nucleic acid cargo transfer to patient cells. MSC
EVs represent a superior alternative to MSC-based
therapies, as they lack the ability to replicate and are
much smaller in size, circumventing related safety
concerns such as immunogenicity, teratoma forma-
tion and blood vessel occlusion. However, a key draw-
back with MSC therapies in general is their variable
therapeutic potency, which is dependent on donor
source. As a cell derived therapeutic, this crucial lim-
itation is hypothesized to exist in MSC EVs as well.
Here, we demonstrate the varying bioactivities of iso-
lated MSC EVs from differing donors and tissue
sources.
Methods: Six separate MSC lines were obtained from
different donors, with three MSC lines derived from
donor adipose tissue, and the other three from the
bone marrow of separate individuals. EVs were isolated
from each MSC line at passage 3 via differential cen-
trifugation and ultrafiltration. These isolated MSC EVs
were then characterized for size/concentration via
nanoparticle
tracking
analysis,
and
EV
markers
(TSG101, ALIX, CD63) via western blot. Pro-vascular-
ization capacities of MSC EVs were determined by a
gap closure assay using human umbilical cord vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs).
Results: Characterization of MSC EVs revealed similar
sizes and EV marker expression across donor groups,
regardless of tissue source. Furthermore, comparison of
adipose tissue-derived (AD) MSC EVs from three
donors indicates varying pro-vascularization bioactivity
between those donors evaluated in vitro via gap closure
assay. Similar results were observed for the bone mar-
row-derived (BM) MSC EV donor groups.
Summary/Conclusion: This work highlights the need
for screening of donor derived-MSCs before use for
therapeutic EV production. Additionally, standardized
criteria for MSC donor selection are needed before
isolated MSC EVs can be used as a large-scale, repea-
table therapeutic treatment.

Introduction: Malaria is one the most devastating
infectious disease in the world and Plasmodium falci-
parum (Pf) represents the deadliest species. This para-
site invades human red blood cells (RBCs) and releases
extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying DNA, RNA and
protein cargo components which are involved in the
pathogenesis of the disease. Recently, it has been shown
in mammalian systems that EVs are subdivided into
different subpopulations, each with a distinct biological
function. However, it is still unknown whether Pf-
infected RBCs (Pf-EVs) release different EV subpopu-
lations with distinct cargo.
Methods: We isolated EVs from Pf- infected and unin-
fected RBCs, Pf-EVs or ui-EVs, respectively, using dif-
ferential centrifugation. The EV pellet was subjected to
field flow fractionation (FFF). The different subpopula-
tions were collected, concentrated with size-exclusion
filters
and
evaluated
by
Nanoparticle
Tracking
Analysis. Additionally, the presence of EV markers
(SR1 and HSP90) were examined by Western blot
analysis.
Results: The FFF analysis showed four particle subpo-
pulations derived from the Pf-EVs and five in the ui-
EVs. The first three subpopulations were similar in
their detection signals in both samples, but the fourth
subpopulation was consistently higher in ui-EVs than
in Pf-EVs. Moreover, HSP90 was detected in subpopu-
lations 3 and 4 of both Pf-EVs and ui-EVs, whereas
SR1 only in subpopulation 3.

subpopulations, consistent with the fact that both
samples are derived from host RBCs. Additional
data regarding the DNA and RNA cargo, as well as
microscopic observations of the Pf-EV and ui-EV
subpopulations is necessary. This will clarify how
malaria parasites sort their components into EVs
and which fractions are associated to immune eva-
sion and pathogenesis.

Introduction: We have established a small size labora-
tory production of the microalgae culture in order to
harvest the extracellular vesicles (EVs) for pharmaceu-
tical and medical uses. In this work we report on
globular particles in the isolates from media of micro-
algae of two types, that we recognize as EVs. We
observed changes in their production at different tem-
peratures and conditions.
Methods: Samples were fixed by various combinations
of aldehyde fixatives and/or osmium tetroxide. They
were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, hexam-
ethyldisilazane, and air dried. They were Au/Pd coated
for inspection with Scanning Electron Microscopes
(SEM) Crossbeam 550 FIB-SEM Gemini II (ZEISS,
Germany) and JSM-6500 F Field Emission Scanning
Electron Microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Results: Microalgae were incubated overnight at 22°C
and 37°C in growth medium and in growth medium
supplemented with detergent. The samples obtained
from the microalgae culture contained particles that
we recognized as extracellular vesicles, however, these
particles do not correspond to characteristic shapes of
membrane enclosed entities without internal structure.
Increased temperature and/or presence of surfactant
(Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulphate) stimu-
lated formation of EVs of different shapes and sizes.
The isolates of these samples were rich with EVs. In the
presence of surfactant, the cell-walls detached from the
cell and collapsed upon dehydration. This was docu-
mented by SEM.
Summary/Conclusion: Focused Ion Beam technique
revealed complex internal structure of the algae. It
seems from the shapes of the observed structures that
the particles deposited on the surface of the microalgae
do not derive from budding of the membrane surface,
but are instead shed by the cells from the cell interior
upon the rupture of the cell wall.
