Abstract 
Background:  There is a strong correlation between the morphological features of new tumor vessels and malig-
nancy. However, angiogenic heterogeneity necessitates 3D microvascular data of tumor microvessels for more reliable 
quantification. To provide more accurate information regarding vessel morphological features and improve breast 
lesion characterization, we introduced a quantitative 3D high-definition microvasculature imaging (q3D-HDMI) as a 
new easily applicable and robust tool to morphologically characterize microvasculature networks in breast tumors 
using a contrast-free ultrasound-based imaging approach.
Methods:  In this prospective study, from January 2020 through December 2021, a newly developed q3D-HDMI 
technique was evaluated on participants with ultrasound-identified suspicious breast lesions recommended for core 
needle biopsy. The morphological features of breast tumor microvessels were extracted from the q3D-HDMI. Leave-
one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was applied to test the combined diagnostic performance of multiple morphologi-
cal parameters of breast tumor microvessels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the 
prediction performance of the generated pooled model.
Results:  Ninety-three participants (mean age 52 ± 17 years, 91 women) with 93 breast lesions were studied. The 
area under the ROC curve (AUC) generated with q3D-HDMI was 95.8% (95% CI 0.901–1.000), yielding a sensitivity of 
91.7% and a specificity of 98.2%, that was significantly higher than the AUC generated with the q2D-HDMI (p = 0.02). 
When compared to q2D-HDMI, the tumor microvessel morphological parameters obtained from q3D-HDMI provides 
distinctive information that increases accuracy in differentiating breast tumors.
Conclusions:  The proposed quantitative volumetric imaging technique augments conventional breast ultrasound 
evaluation by increasing specificity in differentiating malignant from benign breast masses.

Background
For decades, angiogenesis has been recognized as a driv-
ing factor for rapid growth and metastasis of malignant 
solid tumors [1]; as such neovascularization plays a 
critical role in breast cancer growth and dissemination. 
Importantly, the structural abnormalities of malignant 
tumor microvessels are evident not only by high den-
sity but also by complexity of the newly formed vessels 
presenting with irregularity and tortuosity [2, 3]. Direct 
assessment of vessel morphological changes as biomark-
ers for cancer detection by imaging modalities is an 
emerging research interest.
Previous research has demonstrated the ability to 
obtain microvascular features of breast tumors at super-
resolution scales [4] although no morphometric analysis 
was performed. A few studies have proposed ultrasound 
imaging of tumor microvessels for differentiation of 
breast masses without using contrast agents [5]; how-
ever, these efforts were limited to a pixel count method 
and visual inspection of images for the assessment of 
vessel shapes and distribution. Recently it has been 
demonstrated that slow blood flows can be successfully 
decoupled from strong tissue clutter signal when highly 
registered spatial–temporal data were processed in the 
singular-spectrum domain [6]. This approach includes a 
set of novel vessel enhancement processing algorithms to 
extract small vessels and suppress unrelated structures in 
the Power Doppler (PD) image. This approach provides 
tissue-blood echo separation and prepares the image for 
quantitative analysis of the microvasculature network 
and its morphology. Noting that this method can visu-
alize small sub-millimeter vessels, as small as 300 µm, it 
has been termed high-definition microvasculature imag-
ing (HDMI) [6, 7]. HDMI is primarily based on using 
ultrafast imaging, providing a significantly higher num-
ber of coherent imaging frames by utilizing plane-wave 
scanning instead of the conventional focused line-by-line 
scanning methods [6]. Quantitative analysis of microves-
sel morphological parameters as new biomarkers is 
described in [8]. In this work, morphological parameters 
of 2D HDMI images of breast lesions were extracted and 
used for lesion characterization [9]. In a more recent 
comparative study [10], it has been shown that adding 
the morphological parameter to those of shear wave elas-
tography parameters improves the overall lesion charac-
terization performance.
The integrity of the microvasculature morphology is 
vital for quantitative analysis [11]. As angiogenesis leads 
to formation of chaotic and tortuous vessels in malignant 
lesions [12], vascular information obtained from sin-
gle imaging plane approach is incomplete [13]. Further-
more, 2D imaging methods overlook some important 3D 
structural features of microvessels and their connectivity, 
leading to underestimation or overestimation of different 
morphological parameters in a 2D plane [14, 15]. There-
fore, 3D microvasculature imaging would be helpful for 
overcoming these limitations as more complete micro-
vasculature information can be obtained.
3D microvasculature imaging for differentiation of 
breast masses including volumetric photoacoustic imag-
ing, [16, 17] and 3D ultrasound localization microscopy 
[4, 11–13] are active research area; however, the latter 
requires IV placement, contrast medium injection and is 
costly. Efforts towards using contrast-free 3-D ultrasound 
imaging of microvessels, taking advantage of a high frame 
rate ultrasound technique, and providing volumetric 
information to differentiate breast masses using a vascu-
lar index have been reported [18]; however, morphomet-
ric analysis was not provided in that study.
In this work, we introduced a contrast-free quantita-
tive three-dimensional high-definition microvasculature 
imaging (q3D-HDMI) method to provide microvascu-
lature morphological information within a tumor vol-
ume. The q-HDMI methods (3D and 2D) objectively 
classify breast tumors in benign or malignant, which 
makes this method less  operator dependent and elimi-
nates the observer/reader variability providing a reliable 
clinical ultrasound imaging. Both the q2D-HDMI and 
q3D-HDMI techniques are not FDA cleared/approved 
and they remain investigational. We tested the hypoth-
esis that the proposed contrast-free 3D microvasculature 
imaging provides complete and more accurate informa-
tion regarding vessel morphological features and outper-
forms q2D-HDMI approach in distinguishing malignant 
from benign breast masses.

of clinical breast imaging, BI-RADS classification using 
grayscale ultrasound BI-RADS features as well as biopsy 
localization have been done by six different radiologists 
with 10–30 years of experience in breast imaging; how-
ever, they were not part of our investigative team and did 
not participate in data interpretation and or data analy-
sis. Those patients with ultrasound-identified suspicious 
breast lesions recommended for biopsies were enrolled 
for this study. A signed written informed consent with 
permission for publication was obtained from each 
enrolled participant prior to the study. From January 
2020 through December 2021, 2 males and 91 females 
were enrolled in this study. None of the patient popula-
tion used in this study was previously reported. Partici-
pants’ information is summarized in Fig. 1. No selection 
bias, such as on age, sex and mass size or presence of vas-
cularity in breast masses was present in our study elimi-
nating pre-test probability of malignancy. All participants 
underwent core needle breast biopsy within an hour 
after the q3D-HDMI studies. Therefore, all the benign 
lesions were pathologically confirmed and did not need 
follow-up visits. A 14-gauge cutting needle was utilized. 
Five biopsy cores were obtained in each case. Pathology 
results reported by an experienced breast pathologist 
with more than 20 years’ experience served as the refer-
ence gold standard.
Quantitative 3D high‑definition microvasculature imaging
Ultrasound scanning was performed by one of two 
experienced sonographers with more than 30 and 
15  years of clinical ultrasound scanning experience. A 
programmable ultrasound machine, Verasonics Vantage 
256 system (Verasonics Inc., Redmond, WA), synchro-
nized with a mechanical servo control scanning system 
was used for the study. A linear probe (L11-4v with cen-
tral frequency at 6.25 MHz) was mounted on a motorized 
mechanical translation arm. The motor controller trans-
lated the linear array transducer along the elevational 
direction during data acquisition (Fig. 2a). Patients were 
asked to lie down on the back. If the lesion was located 
at the breast outer quadrant, a pillow was put behind the 
back with the patient face towards the side. It is known 
that peritumoral microvasculature and its morphology 
are important distinctive factors between malignant and 
benign [9, 19, 20]. Accordingly, our scanning method was 
designed to include the peritumoral vascularity. For this 
purpose, the sonographer first located the breast mass 
on the B-mode image and moved the probe to identify 
mass margins in all directions. Then, depending on the 
mass size, the sonographer repositioned the ultrasound 
probe to a few or several millimeters outside the mass 
margin into the normal background tissue. Starting from 
this point, the probe was set to automatically scan the 
breast in steps, covering the entire mass from one side to 
the other, and stopped a few to several millimeters after 
the mass margin has totally disappeared from the image 
on the opposite side. The sonographer monitored the 
whole scanning process to confirm that the whole mass 
was scanned properly. The translation step size was kept 
at 0.5  mm for all studies, providing a balance between 
acquisition time and 3D image quality. At each step, 
plane wave imaging was performed at a pulse repetition

frequency of 550  Hz and 5 compounding angles. One 
thousand one hundred frames were acquired. The trans-
ducer was then placed on freeze mode for 2 s to save the 
IQ data. Next, the controller translated the transducer 
to the next scanning plane to continue data acquisi-
tion. Both the transverse and longitudinal orientations 
were acquired for most of the patients. For the lesions 
very close to the nipple, only one orientation easier for 
mechanical arm movement was scanned. In this study, 
the total scanning time was less than 5 min along each 
orientation. During data acquisition, the patient was 
instructed to remain still and breathe normally.
3D reconstruction and quantification of vessel morphology
For each lesion, the raw data acquired at each scanning 
step was first processed using MATLAB (MathWorks, 
Natick, MA) with the q2D-HDMI technique as detailed 
in [6, 7]. Briefly, clutter filtering, background noise reduc-
tion and a series of morphology filtering techniques 
were applied to extract the microvessels. This process 
resulted in a set of successive 2D B-mode images and the 
corresponding microvessel images of lesions along the 
scanning direction, as shown in Fig. 2b.
The 2D images were then imported into a commercial 
software package, Amira 3D (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, 
MA), for 3D reconstruction [21]. Details for the 3D vol-
ume rendering setup are shown in Appendix 1. Figure 2b 
shows an example with the reconstructed microves-
sel image overlaid on the dilated lesion image. Finally, 
the 3D structure was exported as a series of 2D images 
for extracting quantitative parameters. To include more 
peripheral zone vascularity, each extracted 2D image 
from 3D scanning was segmented with 2 to 5 mm dila-
tion operation, depending on size of breast mass.
MATLAB was used for quantitative analysis of the 
2D images obtained from Amira 3D. The thinning algo-
rithm as described in [7, 22] was used to extract the 
skeleton. Figure 2c shows the 3D skeleton image exam-
ple reconstructed using MATLAB. The skeleton image 
was used for extracting quantitative parameters: vessel 
density (VD), maximum vessel diameter (Dmax), mean 
vessel diameter (Dmean), maximum Murray’s deviation 
­(MDmax), mean Murray’s deviation ­(MDmean), maximum

parameters were extracted based on the 3D structure. Finally, the quantitative parameters could be input to the statistical model for lesion 
differentiation. HDMI = high-definition microvasculature imaging

bifurcation angle ­(BAmax), mean bifurcation angle 
­(BAmean), microvessel fractal dimension (mvFD), num-
ber of branch points (NB), number of vessel segments 
(NV), mean tortuosity (τmean) and maximum tortuosity 
(τmax). The same parameters were also obtained for q2D-
HDMI by analyzing the microvessel image acquired at 
the scanning step, which corresponded to the B-mode 
image with the largest lesion cross section. The detailed 
list of microvessel morphological Parameters is shown in 
Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with RStudio (R ver-
sion 4.0.4, Boston, MA, USA). The Wilcoxon rank sum 
test was used to compare the quantitative parameters 
by malignancy status. A two-sided p value less than 
0.05 was considered statistically significant. In cases, 
where the vessel has no branches, the values for ­BAmean, 
­BAmax, ­MDmean and ­MDmax parameters are undefined, 
and the quantification algorithm outputs a not a number 
(NaN) value. Analysis with the NaN value is described 
in Appendix 2. All quantitative parameters, including 
the sub-parameters were combined using the multi-
variable logistic regression analysis, and those with high 
p values (> 0.05) were dropped from the model as the 
addition of these parameters did  not improve the pre-
diction accuracy. To finally test the combined diagnos-
tic performance of multiple morphological parameters, 
including the sub-parameters, leave-one-out cross-val-
idation (LOOCV) was used. The LOOCV method has 
the advantage that it can compensate for the overfit-
ting problem due to a limited sample size [23]. Malig-
nancy probability was calculated for each lesion, and 
malignancyprobability = logit−1(B +
n
i=1 CiPi) , where 
B and Ci are constants obtained from LOOCV, Ci is the 
coefficient for the corresponding quantitative biomarker 
Pi ; n is the number of quantitative biomarkers included 
in the prediction model; logit−1(α) = 1/(1 + exp(−α)) . 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 
used to evaluate the performance of the pooled model 
predictions generated from the LOOCV analysis, and 
the optimal cut-point was defined as the point closest 
to the point (0,1) on the ROC curve. The corresponding 
95% confidence interval (CI), sensitivity, specificity, posi-
tive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value 
(NPV) were compared to evaluate the performance of 
different models. DeLong’s test for paired observations 
[24] was also conducted based on the area under the 
curve (AUC) for the model performance comparison. 
ROC curves generated with the VD, NB, τmean, mvFD, 
­MDmax, ­MDmean, ­BAmax and ­BAmean for differentiating 
benign from malignant lesions using q2D-HDMI and 
q3D-HDMI were compared. For both q2D-HDMI and 
q3D-HDMI, quantitative parameters VD, mvFD, τmax, 
NV, NB, Dmean were included in the LOOCV model.
Results
q3D‑HDMI biomarkers outperformed q2D‑HDMI 
biomarkers for breast lesion differentiation
Of the 93 enrolled patients (mean age 52 ± 17  years, 
ranges from 18 to 84 years, 2 men and 91 women), 93 
breast masses were examined by q3D-HDMI imaging. 
Table  2 summarizes the lesion information included 
in this study. Lesion size along the largest dimen-
sion ranged from 3 to 46  mm with a mean value of 
14.7 ± 9.4  mm. Ultrasound guided core needle breast 
biopsy results revealed 57 benign and 36 malignant 
lesions. The most common benign histologic type 
was fibroadenoma n = 24 (42.1%). Among the malig-
nant lesions, the most common was invasive ductal 
carcinoma (IDC), n = 28 (77.8%). The morphological 
parameters of q3D- and q2D-HDMI for benign and 
malignant lesions are summarized in Table 3. For both 
the q2D-HDMI and q3D-HDMI, the values for VD,

mvFD, NV, τmax and τmean were significantly higher for 
malignant lesions with p < 0.001. Significant differences 
between benign and malignant lesions were found for 
both the Dmean and Dmax obtained from q2D-HDMI 
with p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively. However, 
no significant difference was found for Dmean or Dmax 
obtained from q3D-HDMI with p = 0.35 and p = 0.42, 
respectively.
The boxplots for four representative biomarkers VD, 
NB, τmean and mvFD obtained with q3D-HDMI and 
q2D-HDMI are shown Fig. 3. Compared to q2D-HDMI, 
the q3D-HDMI showed higher mean NB, τmean and 
mvFD. Also, q3D-HDMI showed lower averaged VD 
values for both benign and malignant lesions; this was 
expected as the vessel density in 2D is calculated per unit 
area, whereas in 3D it is calculated per unit volume. As 
shown in Fig.  3, ROC curves generated with a param-
eter obtained from q3D-HDMI demonstrated improved 
discrimination versus those generated with the same 
parameter obtained from q2D-HDMI. Significant differ-
ence was found for the ROC curve for NB with the cor-
responding DeLong test p values < 0.001.
The conventional B-mode and Doppler ultrasound, 
q2D- and q3D-HDMI images of two malignant lesions, 
large (as large as 36-mm) and small (as small as 3-mm) 
and two benign breast lesions are shown in Fig. 4 for vis-
ual comparison. The corresponding videos of the 3D ren-
dered microvasculature images are shown in Additional 
files 1–4. For both the large and small malignant lesions, 
while 2D-HDMI shows high-definition images of tumor 
vascularity, the 3D-HDMI shows complete connectivity 
of vascularity inside and around the breast tumor. For all 
lesions, there are more microvessels with complete con-
nectivity in the q3D-HDMI images. Compared to q2D-
HDMI, the benign lesion vessels shown in q3D-HDMI 
are more regular and straight with fewer branch points, 
presenting less complexity when compared to those of 
both of large and small malignant masses, indicating the 
benignity of these breast lesions. The quantitative bio-
markers obtained by both q3D-HDMI and q3D-HDMI 
are detailed in the table in row below of each breast 
lesion in Fig. 4 for comparison.

Lesion differentiation analysis with LOOCV
The ROC curves generated with ­MDmax, ­MDmean, ­BAmax 
and ­BAmean obtained from q3D-HDMI and q2D-HDMI 
are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. All four param-
eters obtained from q3D-HDMI gave a significantly 
higher AUC when compared to the results obtained from 
q2D-HDMI, with p < 0.001. For both q2D-HDMI and 
q3D-HDMI, quantitative parameters VD, mvFD, τmax, 
NV, NB, Dmean were included in the ROC Curves gener-
ated with the LOOCV model, as shown in Fig. 5c. The 
AUC for ROC curve of the q2D-HDMI was 83.8% (95% 
CI 75.2–92.3%). The corresponding sensitivity, specific-
ity, PPV, and NPV were 86.1%, 75.4%, 68.9% and 89.6%, 
respectively. The AUC increased significantly (p = 0.02)

The malignancy probability [9] was calculated with 
LOOCV for q3D-HDMI. Figure  5d shows the malig-
nancy probability distribution for each lesion in each 
BI-RADS category for q3D-HDMI. The cutoff value 
of the malignancy probability is 0.668, denoted by a 
red dashed line in Fig.  5d. As illustrated in Fig.  5d, 
the benign and malignant lesions in BI-RADS 3 and 
4 groups were captured successfully with the q3D-
HDMI. There were three false negatives (represented 
by red dots below the red dashed line) and one false 
positive (represented by blue dot above the red dashed 
line). Among the three false negatives, there were two 
ductal carcinomas in  situ (DCIS), low nuclear grade 
cribriform type, one 9 mm, and the second was 14 mm 
in diameter. The third false negative case was a male 
patient whose breast pathology indicating a 20  mm 
invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of 
III), subtype category of Luminal A (estrogen and pro-
gesterone receptors positive, HER2- negative and low 
levels of the protein Ki-67). The pathology of false posi-
tive was a 12  mm size fibroadenoma with lactational 
changes in background breast parenchyma from a 
female patient. The biopsy results of benign lesions also 
revealed 3 radial scars and 12 fibrocystic changes with-
out hyperplasia. The prediction model of q3D-HDMI 
correctly predicted all three radial scars and 12 fibro-
cystic changes as benign. Figure  6 shows an example 
of a 8 mm radial scar next to a 10 mm invasive ductal 
carcinoma.
Discussion
In this study, we presented in  vivo imaging of breast 
tumor microvessels volumetrically along with com-
prehensive quantitative analysis of tumor microvessels 
extracted from the novel q3D-HDMI for the first time. 
No contrast agent was applied. We demonstrated that 
q3D-HDMI outperforms the 2D approach and increases 
the accuracy in malignancy prediction of breast lesions.
The results of our study included one false positive. The 
pathology confirmed the lesion to be a fibroadenoma with 
lactational changes in background breast parenchyma. 
It is known that fibroadenoma is a hormone sensitive

tumor and often becomes enlarged with increased vas-
cularity during pregnancy and lactation. Furthermore, 
fibroadenoma tends to get atypical radiological features 
during pregnancy and lactation, necessitating core nee-
dle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis [25]. The study also 
included 3 false negatives. The pathology of two of false 
negatives was DCIS with low nuclear grade cribriform 
type. Studies show that low-grade DCIS tend to have less 
vascularity and may develop into low-grade invasive car-
cinoma [26]. Indeed, Grade 1 DCIS generates much less 
angiogenesis than high nuclear grade of DCIS [27]. In 
other words, the false negativity of these low-grade DCIS 
in our study is more physiologic than a technical issue. 
The third false negative was IDC Nottingham grade II 
(of III), subtype category of Luminal A. It is known that 
luminal A subtypes are slow growing cancers and have 
low microvessel density with less structural complexity 
and they maintain the best prognosis among all subtypes 
[28]. In other words, this false negative IDC was more 
physiologic than a technical issue.
Radial scars are often difficult to differentiate from 
IDC on conventional imaging and pathology review is 
often non-trivial [29]. All three radial scars included in 
this study were correctly predicted as benign. Thus, with 
q3D-HDMI, the microvasculature features of radial scars 
could assist for more accurate differentiation. Further-
more, the proposed prediction model correctly predicted 
all the masses with fibrocystic breast changes without 
evidence of hyperplasia as benign. Our finding is sup-
ported by report of previous study indicating that fibro-
cystic breast disease without hyperplasia shows lower 
grade microvessel density compared to those associated 
with hyperplasia [30].
Though, 3D power Doppler ultrasound for breast 
cancer diagnosis [31] and contrast agent mediated 3D 
ultrasound localization microscopy on tumor bearing 
rats [13] demonstrated the potential of such volumetric 
techniques; our study demonstrated the effectiveness of 
the q3D-HDMI through a comprehensive quantitative 
in  vivo study for characterization of breast masses in 
human.
It is known that angiogenesis, the formation of new 
microvessels toward and within a malignant breast 
tumor, starts when the tumor reaches the size of 2–4 mm 
in diameter [32]. One of the important findings in this 
study is that q3D-HDMI was able to capture the micro-
vasculature structures in a breast lesion as small as 3 mm. 
Furthermore, the q3D-HDMI displayed more vessels 
with better connectivity in this small tumor than what 
was possible with q2D-HDMI. As a result, the predic-
tion model based on q3D-HDMI quantitative biomark-
ers correctly diagnosed this small lesion as malignant. It 
is known that male breast cancer has even more intense 
angiogenic reaction than female breast cancer [33], this 
is in support of our study, which included two men with 
breast masses and q3D-HDMI quantitative biomarkers 
correctly diagnosed them as invasive ductal carcinoma.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to 
compare 3D and 2D microvessel images quantitatively 
and demonstrates that the new 3D microvasculature 
imaging technique, q3D-HDMI, is superior to the cur-
rent q2D-HDMI method for several reasons. With 2D 
microvasculature imaging, only one plane of the lesion 
can be evaluated [13]. In our study, for the 2D analysis, 
the microvessel image corresponding to the B-mode 
image with the largest lesion area was selected. How-
ever, the microvasculature information in the malignant 
lesion is highly spatially heterogeneous, and therefore the 
microvessel information could largely vary from slice to 
slice, making it hard to select a representative 2D slice for 
analysis. Therefore, the microvasculature morphological 
features obtained on a single plane in 2D imaging may 
not be a true estimation and could be underestimated 
or overestimated [14]. For example, our study showed 
that the mvFD, NB and tortuosity information obtained 
from q3D-HDMI was significantly higher than the same 
parameters obtained from q2D-HDMI and significantly 
different in benign and malignant. In addition, q2D-
HDMI can visualize the vessel only in a two-dimensional 
space, hence vessels extending outside the imaging plane 
and their morphological parameters would not be cap-
tured. On the other hand, q3D-HDMI captures the entire 
vessel network and their morphological parameters, pro-
viding a more accurate estimation of such parameters. 
This finding is in agreement with previous study [14]. 
Our study also showed that the vessel density measured 
with q2D-HDMI was significantly higher than that meas-
ured with 3D, indicating that q2D-HDMI overestimated 
microvessel density. However, this is expected as the ves-
sel density in 2D is calculated per unit area, whereas in 
3D it is calculated per unit volume.
In this study, the recently introduced parameters for 
breast cancer detection, Murray’s deviation [8, 34], rep-
resenting the relationship between mother vessel and 
daughter vessels and bifurcation angle [8, 35] based on 
information between the daughter vessels, were signifi-
cantly different in benign and malignant in q3D-HDMI 
approach, indicating its ability to accurately visualize 
branches information in a 3-dimensional space. However, 
for q2D-HDMI, most of the lesions resulted in NaN val-
ues for these two parameters, suggesting that no daugh-
ter vessels were observed.
Microvessel morphology and its distribution feature 
vary between benign and malignant breast tumors and 
are likely to be an important discrimination marker [2, 
36]. Studies have shown that morphological parameters 
Page 12 of 15
Gu et al. Breast Cancer Research           (2022) 24:85 
of tumor microvessels obtained from contrast-free 
quantitative 2D-HDMI increases the sensitivity and 
specificity in discriminating malignant from benign 
breast masses [7, 9, 10]. The study presented here 
shows that morphological biomarkers of microvascula-
ture network obtained by 3D-HDMI outperforms those 
of q2D-HDMI and increases the sensitivity and speci-
ficity in differentiating malignant from benign breast 
masses. It is known that the morphology of the vascu-
lature in the immediate vicinity of breast tumors plays 
a significant role in differentiation between cancerous 
and benign masses. Studies in [19, 37] used a combined 
optoacoustic and ultrasound images of breast tumors to 
show that aggressively growing malignant tumors tend 
to recruit vasculature from the immediate proximity so 
that small arteries penetrate cancerous tumors radially. 
In contrast, benign tumors push surrounding vascula-
ture out, so those vessels appear on and parallel to the 
surface of fibroadenomas.
The performance of combined OA and grayscale US 
for breast lesion differentiation has been shown in [19, 
37]. Study in [19] also showed that OA/US increased the 
specificity of breast mass assessment compared with the 
device internal grayscale ultrasound alone. A direct com-
parison of the sensitivity/specificity for HDMI and OA/
US requires a separate comparative study. However, since 
HDMI and OA/US present different characteristics of 
breast lesions, it is expected that they could complement 
each other in breast lesion differentiation. Therefore, it will 
be interesting to combine q3D-HDMI with OA/US in the 
future to further improve the specificity of breast lesion 
differentiation and reduce the unnecessary biopsies.
Our study had limitations. The sample size was small. 
Also, to have pathology as gold reference standard, only 
the participants with recommendation for breast biopsy, 
nearly all BI-RADS 4 and 5, were enrolled in this study. 
This prevented a direct comparison between q3D-HDMI 
and gray scale ultrasound. In the future, we plan to apply 
this method on a larger population irrespective of their 
BI-RADS category. Also, there is a potential for data 
degradation due to breathing motions, as patients were 
allowed to breathe normally during data collection. In 
the future we plan to utilize and expand the motion cor-
rection algorithms [38–40] to reduce potential motion 
artifacts or to use deep learning technique [41, 42] with 
potential for correction of motion artifacts.
Conclusions
In summary, our study comprehensively  assesses 
tumor microvessel morphological features in a three-
dimensional space using our novel contrast-free ultra-
sound-based quantitative 3D-HDMI. All quantitative 
parameters obtained from the q3D-HDMI outperformed 
the q2D-HDMI in differentiating malignant versus 
benign breast masses. Appendix 3 explains a practical 
way for applying this new q3D-HDMI technique clini-
cally. In the future, the proposed method can offer a new 
means for breast mass characterization when used as a 
complementary imaging tool to conventional ultrasound.
Appendix 1: 3D volume rendering using Amira 3D 
and quantification
After importing the 2D images to the Amira 3D software, 
the voxel size along the elevational direction was set as 
0.25 mm as the scanning step size was 0.5 mm. The B-mode 
images at different slices were segmented along the lesion 
boundary to reconstruct the 3D volume of the lesion. Simi-
larly, the 3D microvessel image was reconstructed using the 
ensemble of the 2D microvessel images along the elevational 
direction. The “Structure enhancement filter” function was 
first applied to automatically identify the blood vessels, and 
therefore, enhanced the 3D structures [21]. With this fil-
ter, a score between 0 and 1 was computed for each pixel 
in the 3D image, with 0 representing the background and 
1 representing a good matching with the structure model. 
The score was calculated based on the Hessian matrix of the 
image and the Hessian matrix was computed by filtering the 
image with the derivative of a Gaussian kernel. The size of 
the Gaussian kernel controlled the scale of analysis since the 
structures were detected from minimum standard deviation 
value to the maximum value at a constant step size. In this 
study, the standard deviation maximum and minimum val-
ues were set as 1 and 2, respectively, and the step was set 
as 0.5. The lesion volume was dilated 2 mm along the seg-
mented lesion boundary, and the 3D microvessel image was 
masked with the dilated lesion volume.
Later, the “Threshold by criterion” function was applied 
to the 3D structure. The criterion value was set between 
0 and 1.0, and the signals with amplitude less than the 
criterion value were considered as artifacts or noise and 
were removed. For most of the lesions, the threshold was 
set empirically as 0.03. A smaller threshold was applied 
for deep-seated lesions as it was expected that signal 
intensity decreased with increased penetration [11, 43]. 
A larger threshold was applied if obvious large motion 
artifacts existed. Appendix Fig. 7a shows an example for 
the 3D microvessel structure. Next, the “Fill holes” func-
tion was used to fill the holes inside the 3D volume struc-
ture using the interpolation method in which voxels with 
at least one common vertex were considered connected, 
irrespective of the volume structure size. After that, the 
“Remove small spots” function was used to remove 3D 
objects with total size less than 30 pixels as they were 
considered as noise or artifacts.

MATLAB was used for quantitative analysis of the 2D 
images obtained from Amira 3D. Appendix Fig. 7b shows 
the 3D microvessel structure generated using MAT-
LAB. The thinning algorithm as described in [7, 44] was 
used to extract the skeleton. Appendix Fig. 7c shows the 
binary skeleton image. The skeleton image was used for 
extracting quantitative parameters, as described in [7, 8].
Appendix 2: Statistical analysis 
with the parameters with NaN value
In cases, where the vessel has no branches, the values for 
­BAmean, ­BAmax, ­MDmean and ­MDmax parameters are unde-
fined, and outputs a not a number (NaN) value. These NaN 
values embody structural missingness and contain infor-
mation that either no vessel was detected in the lesion, or 
if there was a vessel, it did not have any branches. There-
fore, it is important to use this information in the statisti-
cal analysis. Two sub-parameters were derived for each of 
the above-mentioned parameters. The first sub-parameter 
was assigned a binary value of 0 if the parameter value was 
a NaN, or 1, if the parameter value was not a NaN. With 
this definition, this sub-parameter simply indicates the 
presence or absence of a branch. The second sub-parame-
ter was defined as a continuous variable; it was assigned 0 if 
the parameter value was a NaN, or the original value of the 
parameter if it had a numeric value. In order to evaluate the 
diagnostic performance of individual parameters ­BAmean, 
­BAmax, ­MDmean and ­MDmax, the pair of sub-parameters 
corresponding to each of these parameters were tested sep-
arately using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
Appendix 3: Clinical application of the quantitative 
3D high‑definition microvasculature imaging
The q3D-HDMI is a quantitative approach, and objectively 
classifies breast tumor in benign or malignant, which makes 
this method less  operator dependent and eliminates the 
observer/reader variability. The clinical application of this 
technique would be: 1) quantitative biomarkers, which are 
extracted automatically by the ultrasound machine imple-
mented with the q3D-HDMI algorithm, are combined with 
the prediction model and a malignancy probability will be 
given for each scanned lesion. The scanning time required 
for each lesion along each orientation is less than 5  min. 
With advanced and powerful computation system, real time 
processing is possible. 2) The malignancy probability is then 
compared with the cutoff value. The cutoff value proposed 
in this study does not represent the final optimized value 
for general population. Multi-center, large population stud-
ies should be conducted to calculate and validate the cutoff 
value. 3) If the malignancy probability is higher than the 
cutoff, indicating that the 3D scanning supports the biopsy. 
Otherwise, the 3D scanning supports for follow-ups. We 
want to clarify that the q3D-HDMI technique proposed in 
this study is not used for replacing the conventional B-mode, 
or current imaging techniques, but as a complementary for 
improving the sensitivity and sensitivity in breast lesion dif-
ferentiation. The final decision whether the patient should 
undergo the biopsy should be the decision of the radiologist.
