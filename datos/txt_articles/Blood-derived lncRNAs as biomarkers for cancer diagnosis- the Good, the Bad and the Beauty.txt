Cancer ranks as one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. The high mortality rate associated with cancer is partially due to the lack
of reliable early detection methods and/or inaccurate diagnostic tools such as certain protein biomarkers. Cell-free nucleic acids
(cfNA) such as circulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed as a new class of potential biomarkers for cancer
diagnosis. The reported correlation between the presence of tumors and abnormal levels of lncRNAs in the blood of cancer patients
has notably triggered a worldwide interest among clinicians and oncologists who have been actively investigating their potentials
as reliable cancer biomarkers. In this report, we review the progress achieved (“the Good”) and challenges encountered (“the Bad”)
in the development of circulating lncRNAs as potential biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. We report and discuss the diagnostic
performance of more than 50 different circulating lncRNAs and emphasize their numerous potential clinical applications (“the
Beauty”) including therapeutic targets and agents, on top of diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. This review also summarizes the
best methods of investigation and provides useful guidelines for clinicians and scientists who desire conducting their own clinical
studies on circulating lncRNAs in cancer patients via RT-qPCR or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).

INTRODUCTION
Cancer ranks as one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Despite
ongoing efforts to develop new treatments and a better
understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis, it
remains difﬁcult to treat cancers, particularly when diagnosed at
late stages with a poor prognosis. The high mortality rate
associated with cancer is partially due to the lack of early
detection methods and/or inaccurate diagnostic tools, such as
certain protein biomarkers. Protein or peptide-based biomole-
cules such as glycoproteins constitute most of the currently
available cancer biomarkers. Variations in their levels in tissues or
blood may indicate the development of diseases such as cancer.
Protein markers can be detected in tissue biopsy sections
analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) upon diagnostic nota-
bly to determine cancer molecular subtype. For instance, breast
tumor tissues are commonly assessed for the presence of
estrogen receptor (ER) to determine their ER-positive or ER-
negative status. However, some protein biomarkers are report-
edly unreliable as they generate a signiﬁcant amount of false-
positive and/or false-negative results. Plasma alpha fetoprotein
(AFP), one of the most frequently used biomarkers for diagnosis
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)1, has been described by many
as a marker with low sensitivity and/or speciﬁcity2–5. Conven-
tional serological biomarkers such as carbohydrate antigen 153
(CA153), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), CA27.29 and carcinoem-
bryonic antigen (CEA) remain controversial due to poor speciﬁcity
and
sensitivity6–11.
The
poor
reliability
of
certain
protein
biomarkers is partially due to the nature of the biomarker itself.
The detection of proteins and peptides indeed relies on the use of
antibodies that may or may not be speciﬁc to the desired marker
as the epitope recognized by the antibodies may be present on
other
tissue
components12.
Unreliable
antibodies
currently
represent a major issue in biomedical research in general and
can signiﬁcantly comprise the outcome of a study or diagnosis.
Another issue with traditional histology analyses is the need for
actual tissue biopsies. This invasive and inconvenient technique
may discourage potential cancer patients to proceed with the
entire diagnosis procedure. Thus, the development of noninva-
sive nonprotein biomarkers is currently needed.
Cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA) or circulating nucleic acids (CNAs)
have recently been proposed as a new class of potential
biomarkers that could improve cancer diagnosis13. CNA PCA3
(prostate cancer associated 3) has notably been approved by the
FDA and is currently being sold as Progensa by Hologic Gen Probe
(Marlborough, MA, USA) for the diagnosis of prostate cancer14–16.
Circulating long noncoding RNAs or lncRNAs (noncoding RNAs of
200 nucleotides or more), such as PCA3 seem more reliable than
other CNAs due to their high stability in the bloodstream and poor
sensitivity to nuclease-mediated degradation. Arita et al. especially
showed that plasmatic lncRNAs are resistant to degradation
induced by repetitive freeze-thaw cycles, as well as prolonged
exposure to 45 C and room temperatures17. The stability of
lncRNAs in the bloodstream appears to originate from the
presence of extensive secondary structures18, the transport by
protective exosomes19, as well as stabilizing posttranslational
modiﬁcations.
The
reported
prevalence
of
ncRNAs
in
the
mammalian
genome
and
the
known
association
between
aberrant lncRNA expressions and tumorigenesis undeniably high-
light the crucial biological importance of ncRNAs in health and
disease. NcRNAs are particularly known to be major regulators of
cell proliferation and differentiation during development and in
adult life through complex mechanisms which are still being
investigated. In a pioneering study published in 2007, Rinn et al.
notably reported that lncRNA HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense
RNA) was capable of repressing transcription in trans across the
HOXD locus and interacting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2
(PRC2) while being required for PRC2 occupancy and histone H3
lysine-27 trimethylation of HOXD locus20. Many more mechanisms

have been described and continue to be discovered, as scientists
and clinicians actively investigate the mechanisms of action of
lncRNAs as well as their potential as reliable cancer biomarkers.
The high stability and relative abundance of lncRNAs in the
circulation may make them more reliable cancer biomarkers
compared to other analytes such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs),
cell-free DNA (cfDNA, which includes circulating tumor DNA
ctDNA) and exosomes. CTCs and ctDNA are present in limited
quantities in the ﬂuids of cancer patients especially those with
early-stage cancers, which may signiﬁcantly hinder their quanti-
ﬁcation in clinic, while impairing the detection of low allelic
frequency mutations21,22. Moreover, CTCs are very heteroge-
nous21, and the value of CTCs as diagnostic biomarkers remains
currently unclear as early lesions may still be benign and devoid
of CTCs21. ctDNA on the other hand, may not be sufﬁcient to
provide an accurate diagnosis and is often used in combination
with other methods in diagnostic and prognostic studies. As for
tumor-derived exosomes, the detection of glycoprotein biomar-
kers on their surface relies heavily on the speciﬁcity of antibodies.
Lysed exosomes could be alternatives that release the nonprotein
content including lncRNAs, which are easier to detect compared
to proteins.
In this report, we review the progress achieved and challenges
encountered in the development of circulating lncRNAs as
potential biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. We report and
discuss the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of blood-based lncRNAs
currently considered as promising biomarkers for various cancers
such as hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer
and prostate cancer. We also highlight potential therapeutic
applications for circulating lncRNAs both as therapeutic targets
and agents, on top of diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Based
on recommendations from different published works, we ﬁnally
provide recommendations for investigators who seek to investi-
gate and compare the levels of circulating lncRNAs in the blood of
cancer patients compared to healthy subjects by RT-qPCR or Next
Generation Sequencing.
BLOOD-BASED LNCRNAS AS POTENTIAL CIRCULATING
BIOMARKERS FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS
Changes in circulating lncRNA levels speciﬁcally correlate with
cancer development
Most studies focusing on circulating lincRNAs have been initiated
based on prior observations reporting changes in lncRNA levels in
cancer
tissue
samples.
For
instance,
MALAT-1
(metastasis-
associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) was ﬁrst shown
to be upregulated in various cancer tissues including lung and
prostate tumors23,24. Using peripheral blood cells as a lincRNA
source for their study, Weber et al. later showed that MALAT-1
levels could reﬂect the presence of nonsmall-cell lung cancer with
a speciﬁcity of 96%25 (Table 1). LncRNA MALAT-1 was also
detected in signiﬁcantly higher quantities in the plasma of
patients with prostate cancer as compared to healthy subjects26
and these changes in circulating MALAT-1 levels correlated with
prostate cancer with relatively high speciﬁcity (84.8%)26. This
study showed that tumors were at the origin of MALAT-1
variations, since the surgical removal of the cancerous tissues
induced a dramatic reduction in circulating MALAT-1, while
plasmatic levels of this lncRNA increased upon ectopic implanta-
tion of a tumoral xenograft in mice26. More studies support the
concept that circulating lncRNAs are, directly or indirectly,
correlated with the presence of tumors in vivo. For instance,
the blood of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was shown
to
contain
elevated
levels
of
lncRNA
HULC
(for
“highly
upregulated in liver cancer”)27,28. Moreover, HULC, H19, HOTAIR
and GACAT2 (for “gastric cancer-associated transcript 2”) were
found to be signiﬁcantly increased in the plasma of gastric cancer
(GC) patients compared to healthy individuals29–32. Alike MALAT-
1 which was primarily detected in tumoral tissue, lncRNA GIHCG
(for “gradually increased during hepatocarcinogenesis”) was
originally found to be upregulated in cancer tissue samples from
HCC and RCC (renal cell carcinoma) tumors33,34. Higher levels of
GIHCG as well as ARSR (for “activated in RCC with sunitinib
resistance”) were also reported in the circulation of renal cell
carcinoma patients34–36. Serum GIHCG levels were notably able to
distinguish
RCC
patients
from
healthy
individuals
with
a
speciﬁcity of 84.8%. Levels of circulating lncRNAs GIHCG and
ARSR signiﬁcantly dropped after resection of RCC tumors, while
plasma levels of H19, A174084 and GACAT2 markedly decreased
in GC patients postoperatively, further supporting a direct
correlation between abnormal levels of circulating lncRNAs and
tumorigenesis29,32,34,35,37,38. In fact, some of these circulating
lncRNAs have shown greater diagnostic performance than
conventional glycoprotein markers. For instance, circulating H19
and RP11-445H22.4 have been reported as more reliable than
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and/or carbohydrate antigen 153
(CA153) for the diagnosis of breast cancer39,40. Likewise, a serum
three-lncRNA signature consisting of PTENP1, LSINCT-5 and CUDR
(also known as UCA1) signiﬁcantly outperformed CEA and CA19-9
in gastric cancer diagnostic studies41.
Other lncRNAs have been reported to detect various cancer
types with relatively high speciﬁcity. For instance, HOTAIR has
shown high efﬁcacy in identifying samples from colorectal cancer
patients with a speciﬁcity of 92.5%42. Changes in plasmatic levels
of lncRNA LINC00152 were found to correlate with gastric cancer
with a speciﬁcity of 85.2%19 (Table 1). LNC00152 has also been
suggested as a reliable blood-based biomarker for hepatocellular
carcinoma43,44. The high prevalence of HCC in certain parts of the
world such as Asia or Africa is undeniably alarming, and it has
become a major public health matter in many countries. Reliable
biomarkers are desperately needed to detect this deadly cancer at
an early stage. Many circulating lncRNAs have shown a signiﬁcant
correlation with HCC and represent promising candidates for HCC
diagnostic applications (Table 1). Several studies from Egypt
identiﬁed lncRNA-UCA1 as a potential serum-based biomarker for
the detection of HCC. The speciﬁcities obtained were 82.1%45 and
88.6%46. These studies also reported WRAP53 and CTBP as
potential biomarkers for HCC with a speciﬁcity of 82.1%45 and
88.5%46, respectively. In Asia, Jing et al. showed that lncRNA
SPRY4-IT1 represents another promising blood-based biomarker
for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma47.
Many more circulating lncRNAs have been proposed as
potential blood-based biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, some
with relatively high speciﬁcity (Table 1)48–50.
Challenges and potential impacts on diagnosis using lncRNA
as biomarkers
The diagnostic power of circulating biomarkers has yet to reach its
maximum potential. Indeed, the diagnostic performance of many
circulating lncRNAs remains relatively poor when taken individu-
ally. Several lncRNAs reportedly have either poor sensitivity or
poor speciﬁcity towards a speciﬁc cancer type, affecting their
potentials as diagnosis biomarkers. Below are some examples:
MALAT-1 has shown a sensitivity of only 58,6% when testing
plasma samples from prostate cancer patients and healthy
subjects. This moderate sensitivity implies that the use of
MALAT-1 as a blood-based prostate cancer biomarker may result
in a signiﬁcant number of false-negative results, as actual cancer
samples
may
not
be
detected.
MALAT-1
has
also
been
investigated as a potential biomarker for nonsmall-cell lung
cancer25,51. However, with a sensitivity of only 56%, MALAT-1 may
also face multiple challenges before becoming a reliable blood-
based biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis (Table 1). One
unsolved issue is notably the reported lack of correlation between

the levels of circulating MALAT-1 in lung cancer patients and the
levels of this lncRNA in lung cancer tissues. Indeed, the
comparative analysis of whole blood samples from 105 lung
cancer patients and 65 healthy subjects revealed a decrease in
blood MALAT-1 levels in cancer patients, while lung cancer tissues
showed
higher
MALAT1
expression51.
The
lack
of
strong
sensitivity and the poor correlation between tissue and blood
levels may arise from the fact that MALAT-1 is reportedly
undergoing a certain degree of degradation in the blood-
stream26. One of the resulting fragments has notably been
referred to as MD-mini RNA (for metastasis associated in lung
adenocarcinoma transcript 1 derived miniRNA)26.
The degradation of MALAT-1 in the bloodstream may not be an
isolated case and, probably, many more lncRNAs are actively
being degraded once they enter the circulation. Degradation of
circulating lncRNAs may increase in cancer patients as several
studies reported that tumorigenesis is often associated with
higher RNAse activity in the bloodstream52. In fact, long before
circulating lncRNAs were considered as potential cancer biomar-
kers, increased RNAse activity in the serum of cancer patients was
suggested as a mean of early cancer detection53,54. In their study,
Reddi and Holland notably reported that 90% of the patients with
pancreatic cancer showed a dramatic increase in serum RNAse
levels (above 250 units/mL). They hence promoted the use of high
serum RNAse activity as a biomarker for pancreatic carcinoma.
Other cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia have also been
reported to be associated with a higher level of plasmatic RNAse
activity55. RNAses circulating in the bloodstream notably consti-
tute cytotoxic agents secreted by immune cells as part of anti-
cancer defense mechanisms that aim at lysing transformed cells
by activating cell death pathways56. For instance, an RNAse
secreted by human eosinophils is known to induce the speciﬁc
apoptosis of Kaposi’s sarcoma cells without affecting normal
human ﬁbroblasts57. RNAse L was shown to suppress prostate
tumorigenesis by initiating a cellular stress response that leads to
cancer cell apoptosis58,59. Tumors, on the other hand, reportedly
display lower RNAse activity to promote protein synthesis and cell
proliferation52. The reported difference in RNAse activity in tumors
versus circulation may explain seemly paradoxical data when
comparing lncRNA levels in tissues and blood such as in the case
of MALAT1. While many studies have shown positive correlations
between tissue and blood lncRNAs, the reported increased RNAse
activity in the blood of some cancer patients may promote the
degradation of circulating lncRNAs to a degree that would depend
on the nature of cancer and/or lncRNA studied. This could
represent a signiﬁcant challenge for investigators as RT-qPCR
analyses may not detect fragments of an investigated lncRNA
possibly compromising the outcome of a study.
LINC00152 is another circulating lncRNA that has been actively
investigated as a potential cancer biomarker. However, LINC00152
has shown a sensitivity of only 48.1% when analyzing plasma
samples from gastric patients and healthy subjects, limiting its
diagnostic performance as well (Table 1). It is currently not clear if
LINC00152 is undergoing degradation in the bloodstream. Other
circulating lncRNAs have shown poor speciﬁcity in the detection
of speciﬁc cancers. For instance, GACAT2 reportedly has a
speciﬁcity of only 28% when comparing plasma samples from
gastric cancer patients and healthy subjects29, while several
studies have shown that H19 is capable of detecting samples from
gastric cancer patients with a speciﬁcity of only 58 %17 or
56.67%60 (Table 1). This implies that diagnosis based on the
quantiﬁcation of plasmatic levels of H19 or GACAT2 may
potentially result in a signiﬁcant number of false-positive results
when testing for gastric cancer. It is also the case for lncRNA
SPRY4-IT1 regarding the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) with a speciﬁcity of only 50%, and HULC for the detection of
gastric cancer (with a speciﬁcity of only 58%)30 (Table 1).

Combination of circulating lncRNAs for greater diagnostic
performance and new technologies for improved lncRNA
detection
To compensate for the moderate speciﬁcity/sensitivity of certain
circulating lncRNAs and increase their diagnostic performance,
several studies have combined the diagnostic values of several
circulating lncRNAs. For instance, Hu et al., integrated lncRNAs
SPRY4-IT1, ANRIL and NEAT1 in their studies on nonsmall-cell lung
cancer and obtained a speciﬁcity of 92.3%, a sensitivity of 82.8%,
and an AUC (ROC) (area under the ROC curve - receiver operating
characteristic) of 0.87661 (Table 1). The combination of serum XIST
and HIF1A-AS1 was able to accurately detect nonsmall-cell lung
cancer as well62. When combined with POU3F3 and HNF1AAS1,
SPRY4-IT1 displayed a sensitivity of 72.8% and a speciﬁcity of
89,4% (AUC: 0.842) in the detection of esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma63. Yu et al. reported that the combination of circulating
lncRNAs
PVT1
and
uc002mbe.2
reﬂected
the
presence
of
hepatocellular carcinoma with a speciﬁcity of 90.6% and a
sensitivity of 60.5%64. The integrated analysis of plasmatic levels
of XLOC_006844, LOC152578 and XLOC_000303 allowed the
detection of colorectal cancer with a speciﬁcity of 84%, a
sensitivity of 80% and an AUC of 0.97565. Other examples include
the combination of lncRNAs RP11-160H22.5, XLOC_014172 and
LOC149086 which produced a sensitivity of 82% and a speciﬁcity
of 73% (AUC: 0.896) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma3
(Table 1). Some studies have investigated the diagnostic signature
of more than 3 circulating lncRNAs. For instance, Yan et al,
reported that a 4-lncRNA panel comprising UCA1, POU3F3,
ESCCAL-1 and PEG10 constitutes a remarkable diagnostic tool
for the accurate and reliable detection of esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC) since this multi-lncRNA panel was capable of
distinguishing ESCC patients from healthy controls with a
sensitivity of 80.20%, a speciﬁcity of 80.20% and an AUC of
0.85366. The authors emphasized that, in terms of diagnostic
performance, the 4-lncRNA panel outperformed each individual
lncRNA, further supporting the clinical value of such a combina-
tory approach. In a separate study, Zhang et al. identiﬁed a panel
of ﬁve plasma lncRNAs (BANCR, AOC4P, TINCR, CCAT2 and
LINC00857) that was able to discriminate GC patients from
healthy controls with an AUC of 0.91, outperforming CEA
biomarker67. Wu et al. have reported that a 5-lncRNA signature
could accurately distinguish serum samples of patients with renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) from those of healthy subjects68. The
combination of lncRNA-LET, PVT1, PANDAR, PTENP1 and linc00963
identiﬁed RCC samples with an AUC of 0.823. Each of these 5
lncRNAs was not individually capable of performing as well as the
5-lncRNA signature. PVT1 and PANDAR have also been investi-
gated as part of a 8-lncRNA signature in plasma samples of
patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma69. The 8-lncRNA
signature was identiﬁed by using a custom nCounter Expression
Assay (Nanostring Technologies, USA) that allows multiplex qPCR
analyses using TaqMan probes. A better diagnostic performance
may also be obtained through the improved detection of lncRNAs
in human samples and novel highly sensitive methods have been
recently developed to achieve this purpose. In a remarkable study,
Chen et al. recently developed a novel biocompatible electro-
chemical biosensor referred to as “SPCE Au NCs/MWCNT-NH2” for
the ultrasensitive detection of lncRNA MALAT1 in non‑small cell
lung cancer70. Importantly, the authors highlighted that, com-
pared to traditional RT-PCR, this new method presents several
major advantages including faster detection and lower cost while
being simpler to operate. In another outstanding study, Morlion
et al. developed a unique custom lncRNA capture sequencing
approach that relies on a set of 565,878 capture probes for 49,372
human lncRNA genes and which is reportedly capable of
enhancing
detection
sensitivity71.
This
custom
enrichment
approach achieved major advancements in lncRNA detection,
since it enables the detection of a broad repertoire of lncRNAs
with better reproducibility and higher coverage than classic total
RNA-sequencing methods.
Overall, the signature generated by the combination of several
blood-based
lncRNAs
reportedly
provides
better
diagnostic
performance than most individual circulating lncRNAs, while the
emergence of new technologies paves the way for a better
detection of lncRNAs in human bioﬂuids.
Circulating lncRNAs as potential blood-based biomarkers for
cancer prognosis
Besides being potential blood-based biomarkers for early cancer
diagnosis, circulating lncRNAs may also constitute valuable
prognosis markers. Most studies assessing the ability of lncRNAs
to predict disease evolution and eventual clinical outcome have
been performed on cancer tissue samples72–74. However, a few
studies based on the analysis of blood-derived samples indicate
that circulating lncRNAs may also be able to reﬂect cancer
prognosis. For instance, changes in plasmatic levels of lncRNAs
XLOC_014172 and LOC149086 can distinguish metastatic HCC
from non-metastatic HCC with a speciﬁcity of 90%, a sensitivity of
91% and an AUC of 0.934 (combined)3. HOTAIR can also be used
as a negative prognostic marker for colorectal cancer with a
sensitivity of 92,5%, a speciﬁcity of 67% and an AUC of 0.8742.
Moreover, lncRNA GIHCG has been proposed as a potential
prognostic biomarker for renal cell carcinoma34. The 5-lncRNA
signature reported by Wu et al., was also capable of discriminating
benign renal tumors from metastatic renal cell carcinoma68.
Similarly, the 8-lncRNA signature recently described by Permuth
et al., reportedly distinguished indolent (benign) intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) from aggressive (malig-
nant) IPMNs69. This 8-lncRNA-signature reportedly had greater
accuracy than standard clinical and radiological features. It was
further improved when combined with plasma miRNA data and
quantitative radiomic imaging.
While early studies suggest that the analysis of circulating
lncRNA levels may contribute to the evaluation of disease
progression,
more
investigations
focusing
on
blood-based
lncRNAs are needed to truly appreciate the prognosis power of
circulating lncRNAs. The best diagnostic/prognostic performance
may actually emerge from the integration of several analytic
methods that combine circulating lncRNA data, miRNA data,
clinical data, quantitative imaging features69 and/or conventional
glycoprotein antigens such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)60
or prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA)14.
Circulating lncRNAs as potential therapeutic agents/targets
for cancer treatment
Circulating lncRNAs should not be considered only as passive
biomedical tools that solely enable the detection and monitoring
of various diseases. They may also constitute effective therapeutic
agents and/or targets in innovative strategies that could treat
various types of cancers including colorectal cancer and renal cell
carcinoma34,75–77. Indeed, lncRNAs have been shown to trigger or
contribute to tumorigenesis notably by interfering with tumor-
suppressive
signaling
pathways
or
acting
as
oncogenic
stimuli78–82. In a Genome-wide analysis of the human p53
transcriptional network, Sanchez et al. notably revealed the
existence of a lncRNA tumor suppressor signature83. GAS5,
CCND1, LET, PTENP1 and lincRNA-p21 have been described as
tumor suppressors36,75,84–87, while MALAT-1, PANDAR, HOTAIR,
H19, PVT1, GIHCG and ANRIL have been characterized as
oncogenic lncRNAs36,75,88–90. At the molecular level, lncRNAs
C Badowski et al.
5
Published in partnership with The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota
npj Precision Oncology (2022)  40 
can promote tumorigenesis by acting as chromatin structure
regulators that modify gene expression91, scaffolds for oncogenic
RNA-binding proteins92 or RNA sponges for oncosuppressor
microRNAs93,94. For instance, lncRNA HOTTIP (HOXA transcript at
the distal tip) was shown to act as a sponge for the tumor-
suppressive microRNA miR-615-3p and dysregulation of HOTTIP
expression was shown to alter levels of miR-615-3p and its target
IGF-2, promoting the formation of RCC tumors94. Many more
mechanisms have been described and continue to be discovered.
Through various pathways, dysregulation of lncRNAs levels
eventually promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion
and/or metastasis94–97. Therefore, lncRNAs do constitute legit-
imate therapeutic targets. However, most mechanistic studies
have been done on cancer tissues or cells, so it is still unclear if
targeting lncRNAs in blood would be sufﬁcient to treat tumors
located deep inside layers of tissues. A more fundamental
question may be to determine whether circulating lncRNAs can
actually penetrate cells and tissues. Nucleic acids are usually
unable to cross the hydrophobic cellular plasma membrane due
to their large size and negative charges carried by the phosphate
groups of nucleotides. In vitro DNA transfection is usually
achieved by using speciﬁc carriers such as lipofectamine. Answers
may come from reports indicating that circulating lncRNAs are, at
least for a part, transported in the blood via extracellular vesicles
such as exosomes19. It has even been reported that 3.36 % of the
total exosomal RNA content is represented by lncRNAs98.
Circulating exosomes are lipid-based extracellular vesicles that
promote the transport of various biomolecules across long
distances within the human body. Microvesicles and exosomes
have notably been characterized as potent messengers that
enable cancer cells to communicate with each other (autocrine
messengers) and also with non-cancerous cells (paracrine and
endocrine messengers99. Because of their lipidic structure,
exosomes can fuse with the plasma membrane of a targeted
cell and release their content inside it, including lncRNAs. It is
thus conceivable that exosome-borne lincRNAs may be used by
cancer cells to spread within the human body. Therefore,
circulating lincRNAs may constitute bonaﬁde therapeutic targets
as much as tissue lncRNAs do (Fig. 1). Besides exosomes, some
circulating lncRNAs may be transported as complexes with
circulatory proteins such as Argonaute (Ago) or nucleophosmin
1 (NPM1) similar to circulating miRNAs100,101. Others may be
transported in blood without any binding partner or speciﬁc
protective structure. These lncRNAs may constitute the easiest
targets for lncRNA-interfering cancer therapy. While the circula-
tory system is devoid of cellular machinery that degrades RNA-
RNA and RNA-DNA hybrids, targeting lncRNAs using ASOs
(RNAseH-dependent antisense oligonucleotide) can effectively
produce signiﬁcant antitumoral effects in vivo. Arun et al. have
notably shown that the systemic knockdown of Malat-1 by
subcutaneous injections of ASOs in an MMTV-PyMT mouse
mammary carcinoma model resulted in slower tumor growth
and a reduction in metastasis102.
Other studies have highlighted the existence of lncRNAs that
are downregulated in cancer tissues103 and the circulation of
cancer
patients51.
Such
downregulated
lincRNAs
may
be
oncosuppressor lncRNAs of which expression is dysregulated
during tumorigenesis. The ectopic delivery of synthetic or
puriﬁed oncosuppressor lncRNAs may constitute a promising
therapeutic strategy in the future (Fig. 1). These therapeutic
oncosuppressor lncRNAs may be administrated as an exosome-
based formula which could possibly treat primary and secondary
tumors as it spreads throughout the body via the circulatory
system. If some circulating lncRNAs are indeed shown to have
oncosuppressive properties in vivo, they may also be uptaken
prior to cancer formation for cancer prevention purposes, similar
to anti-oxidants (Fig. 1).
Cancer-speciﬁc, multicancer and pan-cancer circulating
lncRNA biomarkers and therapeutic targets
A signiﬁcant number of circulating lncRNAs have been reported to
be associated with only one cancer type so far (Table 1). While this
could be due to a lack of studies on these lncRNAs in other cancer
types, it could also imply that certain blood-based lncRNAs may
really be speciﬁc to a unique type of cancer only, which has
signiﬁcant translational applications especially in cancer screening
since the detection of abnormal levels of such lncRNAs in the
circulation would not only be indicative of a cancer diagnosis but
also pinpoint with accuracy the organ affected by the tumor. More
studies need to be undertaken to evaluate the plausibility of these
two scenarios. Interestingly, the integrated analysis of the most
reported circulating lncRNAs and their speciﬁc association with
certain cancers seems to reveal a pattern where some circulating
lncRNAs are apparently able to reﬂect multiple cancers especially
in organs that are close anatomically and/or embryologically
(Fig. 2a, lncRNAs in white letters). For instance, circulating
LINC00152, HULC and UCA1 have been associated with gastric
and liver cancer, two organs that are in close proximity within the
upper abdomen and which both originate from the foregut of the
embryonic endoderm19,30,43,45,46,104. Lung and esophagus which
are located in the thorax and share common embryological
origins (before they split apart during development) also show a
similar circulating lncRNA - SPRY4-IT1 - upon tumorigenesis61,63.
Circulating HOTAIR has been detected in the blood of patients
with cancers of the uterus and colon/rectum, organs that are
located in the pelvis and sometimes fused in congenital diseases
such as persistent cloaca42,105. Levels of circulating lncRNAs PVT-1
and PANDA reportedly reﬂect tumorigenesis or malignancy in the
kidney and pancreas, two organs that are in close proximity and
often grafted together68,69. Circulating PVT-1 also reﬂects tumor
formation
in
the
liver,
an
organ
close
anatomically
and
embryologically to the pancreas64. The fact that cancers from
the same anatomical region or embryological origin display a
similar circulating lncRNA molecular signature is consistent with
the ﬁndings from an integrative study published in 2018 that
analyzed the complete set of tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA),
consisting
of
approximately
10,000
specimens
and
representing 33 cancer types106. In this study, the authors
performed molecular clustering based on RNA expression levels
and other key features and concluded that clustering is primarily
organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin106. More-
over, the embryological origin of human tumors has been largely
discussed and is notably supported by evidence suggesting that
adult somatic cells retain an embryonic program that can be
reactivated in certain pathological conditions promoting the
dedifferentiation into stem cells and eventually tumorigenesis107.
In addition, machine learning has enabled the identiﬁcation of key
stemness features that are associated with oncogenic dediffer-
entiation108 while embryonic stem cell-like gene expression
signatures have been identiﬁed in human tumors109–111. Because
of their involvement in both tumorigenesis and development,
several genes including some coding for lncRNAs have been
referred to as “oncofetal”112. They are reportedly upregulated in
the embryo and downregulated in adults113. However, in some
cancers, these oncofetal lncRNAs may be re-expressed contribut-
ing to tumorigenesis and malignancy114. In this context, cancer
may arise due to loss of cellular differentiation and gain of pluri- or
multipotency with the high proliferative potential characteristic of
stem cells115. This concept notably led to the characterization of
cancer stem cells. In fact, it is believed that, as somatic cells from
different organs of the same anatomic region dedifferentiate into
cancer stem cells, they may indirectly try to recreate the same
embryonic
organ
that
was
originally
responsible
for
their
formation during embryogenesis (which they share in common).
Based on this cumulative information, it is perhaps not surprising
C Badowski et al.

Published in partnership with The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota
to observe similar patterns of blood lncRNA levels in cancers with
the same embryological or anatomical origin as shown in
Fig. 2a, b. However, there are some exceptions and circulating
lincRNAs
may
not
necessarily
change
upon
tumorigenesis
according to organ location or its embryological origin (e.g.
endoderm,
mesoderm,
ectoderm).
For
instance,
circulating
lncRNAs associated with cancer from organs related to reproduc-
tion (e.g. prostate, breast) may not follow such an anatomic/
embryonic pattern as sexual organs are usually not developed
during embryogenesis. Although, in healthy adults, sexual organs
appear to be the main sources of some of the most widely
reported cancer-associated lncRNAs such as PVT1 and MALAT1
that are mostly expressed in the ovaries of healthy women, while
PTENP1 is largely expressed in the testis of healthy men (Fig. 2c).
Those lncRNAs mostly remain poorly expressed in other tissues of
healthy individuals. The fact that many of these lncRNAs are
suppressed in most adult tissues but remain extensively expressed
in sexual organs (either ovaries or testis, exclusively) suggests the
likely involvement of so-called “genomic imprinting”. It essentially
consists in the reprogramming of the epigenetic make-up of
certain key genes according to the sex of the individual during
gametogenesis, which results in the fetus in a parent-of-origin
type of gene expression with transcription occurring only on one
allele while being suppressed on the other (notably through DNA
methylation and histone modiﬁcation). H19 for instance is an
imprinted gene that is known to be transcribed exclusively from
the maternal allele and silenced on the paternal allele116. H19 is in
fact the ﬁrst imprinted lncRNA-encoding gene ever identiﬁed113
and its product, the lncRNA H19 (H19 Imprinted Maternally
Expressed Transcript), has since been the object of numerous
studies to understand its implications in health and disease. H19
lncRNA has notably been reported to play critical roles in both
developments117–119
and
tumorigenesis120–127
and
therefore
legitimately belongs to the class of oncofetal lncRNAs112,128,129.
A major mechanism by which imprinted lncRNAs such as H19
induce or contribute to tumorigenesis likely involves a still poorly
understood event known as “loss-of-imprinting” or LOI that
abnormally restores gene expression on both alleles (i.e. “biallelic
expression”) in adult somatic cells potentially promoting cancer
formation. The reasons for sporadic LOI are not fully understood
but likely involve the partial or complete loss of the imprinted
epigenetic code of certain key regulatory regions within the DNA

sequence notably due to major changes in methylation patterns
(e.g. hypomethylation or hypermethylation) that can reportedly be
induced by exposure to cigarette smoke for instance. This may
affect the ability to recruit insulating proteins such as CTCF
resulting in changes in the chromatic structure including de-
condensation potentially promoting gene expression on the allele
that should otherwise be suppressed. Eventually, it is undeniably
clear that circulating imprinted lncRNAs that are expressed during
development and which reﬂect, in adults, tumors from organs
with
a
same
embryonic
origin
could
constitute
potential
“oncofetal imprinted lncRNA biomarkers” as well as promising
therapeutic targets. These embryo-derived lncRNAs do represent
promising multicancer biomarkers that would not only enable the
detection of various types of cancers but also determine the likely
location of the tumor in the adult body as well as the organ(s)
affected by tumorigenesis. Embryo-related biomarkers such as the
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are already in use for the
diagnosis of many cancers.
The existence of potential pan-cancer circulating lncRNA
biomarkers has also been investigated, including by our lab.
Indeed, in a leading study based on the rigorous and systematic
statistical analysis of gene expression proﬁles of twelve different
cancer types extracted from multiple publicly available databases,
our lab identiﬁed 6 promising pan-cancer lincRNA biomarkers
subsequently termed “PCAN” lincRNAs that are systematically
dysregulated in cancer103. Active efforts are currently undertaken
to explore the full potential of these PCAN lincRNAs by extending
the study to cancers beyond the original 12 cancer types. Upon

validation in blood-based samples, this panel of PCAN biomarkers
could potentially constitute the ﬁrst set of circulating lincRNAs
capable of detecting any kind of cancer in the human body.
Further investigations would also be required to better under-
stand the molecular mechanisms associated with the upregulation
of these PCAN lncRNAs in cancer and to assess whether they could
constitute potential pan-cancer therapeutic targets as well as
imprinted oncofetal genes similar to H19.
Circulating lncRNAs and association with RNA-binding
proteins
While RNA-binding proteins may not interact with circulating
lncRNAs once they reach the bloodstream, they may bind lncRNAs
inside the tumor cells prior to secretion and may actively
contribute to the tumorigenic process. Indeed, many RNA-
binding proteins that interact with lncRNAs have also been
characterized as oncofetal130,131. This suggests that lncRNA-related
tumorigenesis is likely the result of a complex and diversiﬁed
molecular mechanism that involves the upregulation of several
oncofetal genes, including genes coding for oncofetal lncRNAs
and oncofetal lncRNA-binding proteins. Investigators can ﬁnd
information of lncRNA-binding partners by screening databases
such as lncRNome, lncRNAMap, starBase V2.0 and UCSC genome
browser132–135. Further information on the experimental data
which support the lncRNA-protein interactions described in Fig. 3
can be found in Table 2. This table provides substantial scientiﬁc
information that has been extracted from other highly valuable
databases such as NPInter136–139, BioGRID140 and POSTAR3141
which rigorously report data from Afﬁnity Capture-Mass Spectro-

Systematic analysis of these databases actually revealed a
common set of proteins that consistently interacts with the most
reported cancer-related lncRNAs (Fig. 3a)167. Most of these
proteins are associated with cancer formation upon dysregula-
tion, especially IGF2BP3168,169, FUS170,171 and eIF4A3172. This
suggests the likely existence of a pan-lincRNA core protein
interactome that may, by itself, be sufﬁcient to promote
tumorigenesis. However, some of these proteins appear to be
more frequently involved in lncRNA interactions than others and
may play a more central role in cancer formation. For instance,
eIF4A3 was found to interact with 9 of out 10 lncRNAs in the
Table 3.

lncRNA panel reported here (Fig. 3a, b), while FUS was recruited
by 8 out of 10 lncRNAs. Therefore, eIF4A3 and FUS may constitute
key lncRNA-binding proteins that could be part of a pan-cancer
molecular mechanism that mediates the tumorigenic properties
of most oncogenic lncRNAs and/or generally promotes lncRNA
secretion into the systemic circulation from the tumor site. Thus,
eIF4A3 and FUS may represent major pan-cancer therapeutic
targets. While other RNA-binding proteins appear to be less
frequently recruited by cancer-related lncRNAs, they may still
exert pan-tumorigenic properties since all RNA-binding proteins
reported here in Fig. 3a are part of a very same multimeric protein
complex based on data from an extensive search of protein-
protein interactions using BioGRID database (Fig. 3c). Interest-
ingly, eIF4A3 and FUS showed the highest ability to interact with
other RNA-binding proteins (respectively binding 4 and 5 other
protein partners within the complex), which may explain why
they are often associated with lncRNAs since the more lncRNA-
binding proteins they bind, the more lncRNAs they collect. Given
the relatively high frequency of recruitment of eIF4A3, FUS and
related
RNA-binding
proteins
(RBPs)
by
cancer-associated
lncRNAs and their known roles in tumorigenesis, we here provide
in Fig. 4 the putative consensus motifs that enable lncRNAs to
speciﬁcally bind these RBPs, as this may help investigators to
identify novel interactions between their lncRNA of interest and
these
tumorigenic
RBPs
(consensus

Overall, it is clear that lncRNAs and their interacting partners will
constitute innovative therapeutic targets and/or agents in future
cancer therapy strategies.
DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Circulating lncRNAs have been shown to constitute reliable
biomarkers for both cancer diagnosis and prognosis. They have
also been suggested as potential therapeutic targets, notably due
to the fact that they are reportedly transported in the bloodstream
by exosomes which are known to contribute to cancer progres-
sion and metastasis by enabling communication between cancer
cells that produce those exosomes and non-cancerous “target”
cells which may be incited to transform into new cancer cells
under exposure to exosome-borne oncogenic lncRNAs99. Inter-
estingly, those tumor-derived exosomes (or TD-exosomes) appear
to display a unique molecular signature that differs from that of
non-cancerous exosomes potentially providing a window of
opportunity for future antitumoral therapies aiming to stop the
formation of secondary tumors by speciﬁcally targeting TD-
exosomes. In terms of diagnostic performance, while it can be
improved by combining multiple lncRNAs, it is important to note
that the “speciﬁcity” determined in the reported studies refers to
the comparative analysis of samples from healthy volunteers and
patients with speciﬁc cancer. In this particular context, “speciﬁcity”
does not describe the ability to distinguish a certain cancer type
from other cancers. This is particularly relevant since several
circulating lncRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers
for a large variety of different cancers. For instance, MALAT-1
could be used to diagnose prostate cancer26 and nonsmall-cell
lung cancer25,51. Similarly, HOTAIR has the potential to detect both
colorectal42 and cervical cancer105. LINC00152 could lead to the
diagnosis of both hepatocellular carcinoma43 and gastric cancer19.
LncRNA GIHCG has been shown to be involved in the pathogen-
esis of many types of different cancers including liver, cervical,
gastric, renal and colorectal cancer for which it may constitute a
promising biomarker33,34,90,173–175. PVT1 has been reported as a
potential circulating biomarker (alone or in combination with
other lncRNAs) for at least ﬁve different types of cancers including
RCC (kidney), IPMN (pancreas), HCC (liver), MLN (skin), and CVC
(cervix)64,68,176,177. UCA1 constitutes another lncRNA with signiﬁ-
cant multicancer diagnostic potential since it has been reported to
effectively detect (alone or in combination with other lncRNAs) at
least ﬁve distinct cancers such as HCC (liver), GC (stomach), BC
(bladder), CRC (colon) and osteosarcoma (bone)41,45,46,104,178,179.
The increasing number of studies on circulating lincRNAs may
eventually indicate that all circulating lncRNAs reﬂect more than
one cancer and that there is no unique biomarker for each cancer
type or subtype. It has especially been suggested that changes in
lncRNA level in the circulation of cancer patients could be due to a
general pathophysiological response from the body to the
presence of tumors and not due to direct secretions from the
tumors themselves180. This represents a strong argument as
Box 1 Advice on patient recruitment and sample selection
when studying circulating RNAs as biomarkers for early
cancer diagnosis
●
While whole blood has been successfully used in circulating lncRNA
studies51, it is usually not recommended for accurate quantiﬁcation of
circulating RNAs due to variability associated with red and white blood
cells202. Indeed, levels of white blood cells (and thus circulating RNAs) are
likely to change if patients are experiencing chronic or acute inﬂammation
which may not necessarily be related to the disease investigated198,199. Cell-
free samples such as plasma (blood fraction obtained with anti-coagulants)
and serum (blood fraction obtained after coagulation) are more reliable
sources of circulating lncRNAs and have been largely used in studies
comparing circulating lncRNA levels in cancer patients and healthy subjects
(Table 1).
●
Levels of circulating RNAs may also vary within the same group of
individuals (e.g. healthy volunteers) due to internal factors such as patient
hydration level or diet200,201 as well as age, gender and race. Copy number
variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have also
been proposed as possible sources of variations in levels of circulating
lncRNAs.
Consequently,
investigators
usually
collect
relevant
patient
information and compare individuals with similar records.
●
Equal volumes of plasma from different patients may not contain the same
RNA concentration. Inconsistent serum or plasma preparation across
samples may add another level of variability in RNA content especially if
hemolysis could not be avoided. To account for hemolysis, Permuth et al.
visually inspected their samples and measured absorbance at three
different wavelengths. An absorbance exceeding 0.2 for any of these
wavelengths indicated hemolyzed samples69. They further assessed for
blood-cell contaminants by measuring levels of transcripts from MB, NGB
and CYGB genes (for erythrocytes) as well as APOE, CD68, CD2 and CD3 (for
leucocytes).
Box 2 Extraction of circulating lncRNAs from liquid biopsy:
Pitfalls and Recommendations
●
Investigators that wish to use column-based kits should be aware that most
commercially available kits are optimized for non-liquid samples such as
cells or tissues, and not for plasma or serum. Some kits such as the
miRNeasy Serum/ Plasma kit do allow RNA extraction from serum and
plasma, but it is mostly designed for puriﬁcation of microRNAs (miRNAs)
and other small RNAs.
●
Since lncRNAs are naturally scarce in circulation, investigators may wish to
use large volumes of plasma or serum to increase the RNA yield upon
extraction. However, most kits are provided with columns of limited size
which may introduce variability in RNA yields, as investigators often have to
perform successive column-based puriﬁcations with small volumes of the
same sample. If different kit formats are available (for instance mini, midi
and maxi), investigators should proceed with the kit that is the most
suitable for their study based on the volume of samples that is available to
them. Note that if the volume of the original plasma sample is too small, the
RNA yield might be too low for RNA quantiﬁcation and qPCR detection.
●
Despite the relatively low RNA yield generated from blood-based samples,
most kits provide RNA samples of high purity due to solid-phase extraction
and multiple washing steps. Improved RNA extraction may come from the
addition of an organic extraction based on liquid phase separation using
phenol/chloroform. For instance, the mirVana kit which combines both solid
phase (ﬁlter) and liquid phase (chloroform) RNA extraction has been largely
used in cancer studies focusing on circulating lncRNAs17,26,42. This kit
appears popular among investigators because it allows total RNA extraction
from liquid samples (plasma/serum) as well as puriﬁcation of small RNAs
and lncRNAs.

signiﬁcant levels of lncRNAs have been detected in the blood of
cancer-free healthy subjects. This would also explain why there is
sometimes a lack of correlation between circulating lncRNA levels
and cancer tissue lncRNA levels. Thus, circulating lncRNAs may
actually reﬂect the presence of tumors in general. In this context, it
is likely that in the near future pan-cancer circulating biomarkers
could be identiﬁed. On the other hand, the ﬁndings from recent
studies suggest that the detection of a speciﬁc cancer type may be
achieved by using multi-analyte liquid biopsy and multi-modal
strategies, including lncRNA detection181,182. For instance, to
better predict speciﬁc lncRNA-cancer associations, Yan et al.
developed an original method termed DRACA (for “detecting
lncRNA-cancer association”), based on the analysis of ﬁve different
types of features including lncRNAs, miRNAs, genes, cancer types
and cancer prognosis (3)181. We here provide the name of the
databases used by the authors, as these may be useful to other
investigators. StarBase v2.0 was used for lncRNA–miRNA relation-
ships135, lncReg for lncRNA–gene interactions183, lncRNADisease
for lncRNA–cancer associations184, miRTarbase for miRNA–gene
relationships185, MNDR v2.0 for miRNA–cancer relationships186
and DisGeNet for gene–cancer relationships187. DRACA eventually
outperformed other methods in predicting speciﬁc lncRNA-cancer
associations181. In another outstanding study, Sanchez-Salcedo
et al. reported that the speciﬁc detection of prostate cancer can be
performed by using a dual electrochemical hybridization-based
biosensor with enzymatic signal ampliﬁcation for the detection of
both PCA3 lncRNA and PSA mRNA (prostate-speciﬁc antigen, non-
lncRNA)182. One major advantage of this technique compared to
commercial tests, is that it reportedly enables the detection of
PCA3 lncRNA in urine samples of prostate cancer patients without
prior RNA ampliﬁcation. Because the study of circulating lncRNAs
via traditional RT-qPCR or next-generation sequencing methods
can sometimes be quite challenging, we here provide relevant
guidelines that may be useful to investigators who are new to the
ﬁeld (boxes 1–4, and Table 3).
Overall, while the study of circulating lncRNAs is still at an early
stage, the worldwide growing interest in lncRNAs and the
emergence of new technologies to improve their detection,
speciﬁcity, and potential in clinical applications undeniably
increases the chance of discovering one day reliable blood-
based biomarkers that will allow the early and accurate detection
of any type of cancer.

Box 3 Potential issues when performing RT-qPCR with
circulating lncRNAs from liquid biopsy
●
Investigators have the choice to use equal amounts of total RNAs or equal
volumes of RNA extracts.
●
Using equal quantities of total RNAs has drawbacks since the quantity of
total RNAs obtained after extraction from plasma or serum samples is
usually very low and may be undetectable using spectrophotometers, while
the adjustment of all samples to the sample with the lowest RNA
concentration may reduce the output of the subsequent qPCR reaction.
●
When using equal volumes of RNA extracts, normalization using reference
genes becomes indispensable for the analysis of qPCR data by relative
quantiﬁcation (ΔΔCt method). However, there is no consensus on the best
reference genes. They are case-sensitive and must be evaluated for each
study, which may be challenging due to inherent variability associated with
cancer199,202. Ultimately, one must determine whether these variations are
statistically signiﬁcant or not25. Usually, the least variable candidate is
selected by using algorithms such as NormFinder, RefFinder or Gen-
orm25,41,42.
●
Due to poor abundance or recurrent variability, several genes should be
avoided. RPLPO which is a commonly used for tissue sample analysis is not
recommended for the quantiﬁcation of blood-based biomarkers25,203, while
HPRT and GUSB transcripts are not abundant enough in normal human
serum41.
●
Exogenous spike-in controls may be used to account for variability
introduced during RNA extraction, however they do not reﬂect inherent
variations in RNA concentrations prior to RNA extraction180. We recommend
using both spike-in controls and reference genes to better account for
variations in circulating lncRNA levels. Investigators may also evaluate
lncRNA levels by absolute qPCR quantiﬁcation using standard curves made
with reference standards38.
●
All guidelines from Boxes 1, 2 and 3 are summarized in Table 3.
Box 4 Tips for analyzing circulating lncRNAs with next-
generation sequencing-based technologies
●
There are two paradigms in next-generation sequencing technology: short-
read sequencing (35–700 bp)204 and long-read sequencing (>5000 bp)205.
Short-read sequencing provide lower-cost, higher-accuracy data that are
useful for population-level research and clinical variant discovery204, while
long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo
genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing205. In
practice, short-read sequencing is usually used for cancer early diagnosis206.
●
It is necessary to enhance lncRNA concentration by building lncRNA-speciﬁc
cDNA library using oligonucleotide capture technology207. With comple-
mentary oligonucleotide probes, this technology increases the concentra-
tion of lncRNA sequences by at least 25%207. The optimization of probe
sequences is similar to that for microarray technologies208.
●
The computational preprocessing of lncRNA sequencing requires using
Quality-Control (QC) tools such as FastQC209,210 or AfterQC211. The
processed reads are then aligned to a noncoding transcriptome reference
such as LNCipedia212, using tools such as HISAT2213 or BowTie2214. The
mapped reads are assembled to lncRNAs using tools such as StringTie2215.
The quantity of lncRNAs is normalized by the sequencing depth and
transcript length using RPKM, FPKM or TPM method216. The differentially
expressed lncRNAs are detected by tools such as DESeq2217 or edgeR218.
Risk score analysis can determine the association between cancer and
differentially expressed lncRNAs219. By associating lncRNAs with the nearest
protein coding genes, their biological functions may be explored through
gene ontology (GO)220 and KEGG pathway221 analyses. Finally, classiﬁcation
models can be used to identify potential lncRNA biomarkers, with individual
training, testing and valiation datasets222,223. Metrics such as AUC in ROC are
used to measure the effectiveness of the lncRNAs in predicting cancer103.
