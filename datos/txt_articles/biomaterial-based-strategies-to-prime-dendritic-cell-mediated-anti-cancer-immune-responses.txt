ABSTRACT
Cancer immunotherapy has been extremely successful in curing patients over the last decade.
Immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) that unleash the brakes in T-cells to promote cytotoxicity
against cancer cells are the most successful forms of cancer immunotherapy, yet therapeutic
eﬃcacy needs to be improved as only a fraction of patients responds. Dendritic cells (DCs)
are immune cells that prime immune responses by collecting information in tumour tissues,
and carrying that information to T-cells, thus delivering proper information to DCs is
essential. Biomaterial-based approaches can be powerful tools for this purpose, as
biomaterials allow us to deliver a variety of immunotherapeutic agents at the right time and
place. Herein, we review the key concepts of cancer immunotherapy; discuss the principles
for designing biomaterials to deliver immunomodulatory molecules; and outline biomaterial-
based strategies to prime anti-cancer immune responses. Speciﬁcally, we focus on two
widely used forms of biomaterials, multifunctional nanoparticles and biocompatible scaﬀolds.

Introduction
Cancer is one of the major causes of death, respon-
sible for approximately 10 million deaths each year
worldwide. Cancer cells are cells that undergo uncon-
trolled proliferation due to genetic mutations [1].
Conventional cancer therapies have primarily been
designed to directly eliminate cancer cells [2], either
by targeting rapidly proliferating cells (cytotoxic
therapy) or by inhibiting speciﬁc pathways driving
carcinogenesis and tumour growth (targeted therapy).

Cancer immunotherapy is conceptually diﬀerent from
conventional cancer therapies because it takes advan-
tage of the ability of our immune system to recognise
and kill cancer cells [3,4]. Cancer immunotherapy has
been extremely successful over the last decade. In par-
ticular, immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) that
unleash the brakes on T-cells, the strongest cytotoxic
cells in our immune system, have been exceedingly
successful at improving the survival of patients with
many diﬀerent types of cancer [5,6]. Consequently,
Drs James P. Allison and Tasku Honjo, two pioneers
of ICBs, won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine.
While ICB-based cancer immunotherapy has been
greatly successful, a number of issues remain. First,
only a small fraction of cancer patients (this number
depends on the cancer type, but is typically around
20%) respond to ICBs [5,6]. Second, some patients
develop severe autoimmune disease as overactivated
T-cells attack normal tissues/organs [7]. These issues
may be addressed by biomaterial-based strategies that
allow for controlled release of therapeutics to speciﬁc
cells in target organs, potentially enhancing anti-cancer
immunity while minimising the side eﬀects.
In this review, we focus on biomaterial-based strat-
egies targeting dendritic cells (DCs), which play a cen-
tral role in priming anti-cancer immune responses
[8,9]. T-cell-based immunotherapies, including ICBs
and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells [10],
which augment T-cell functions to maximise cancer
cell killing, have been successful for only a fraction of
patients. Priming anti-cancer immune responses is
necessary for the development of T-cell functions
[11,12]. Therefore, we believe that DC-targeting immu-
notherapy based on biomaterials could be the next
breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy.
In this review, we ﬁrst brieﬂy summarise the key
concepts in cancer immunology and immunotherapy,
with an emphasis on DC biology. Then, biomaterial-
based strategies targeting DCs to prime anti-cancer
immune responses are extensively reviewed. We
focus primarily on two diﬀerent types of biomaterials,
multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) and biocompati-
ble scaﬀolds (Figure 1, please see appendix in the sup-
plemental material). Multifunctional nanoparticles
[13–15] can be used to deliver immune modulatory
compounds to target immune cells in speciﬁc tis-
sues/organs.
Biocompatible
scaﬀolds,
which
were
initially developed in the context of tissue engineering
and regenerative medicine [16,17], release various fac-
tors
with
controlled
kinetics
to
recruit/educate
immune cells and re-programme local immune micro-
environments. The key physiochemical parameters of
each biomaterial are described, and how these par-
ameters can be modulated to achieve properties opti-
mal for speciﬁc cancer immunotherapeutic settings
are discussed.
Basic concepts of cancer immunology and
immunotherapy
Cancer-immunity interactions
Cancer-speciﬁc immune responses are mounted by
dynamic
interactions
between
T-cells
and
DCs
migrating through the tumour and LNs, as shown
schematically in Figure 2 [18]. First, DCs carrying anti-
gens from the tumour migrate to the LNs. Then, DCs
prime T-cells in the LNs. Finally, activated T-cells in
the LNs migrate to the tumour to kill cancer cells. Can-
cer cell death can further enhance DC activation by
releasing cancer antigens and danger signals. Thus,
cancer–immune cell interactions form a positive feed-
back loop to amplify anti-cancer immune responses,
in a process called the cancer-immunity cycle.
ICBs enhance T-cell activation and function either
in the LNs, where T-cells are primed by DCs, or in
the tumour, where T-cells kill cancer cells [6]. Anti-
cancer immune responses are often compared to driv-
ing a car. In this analogy, immune checkpoint mol-
ecules are the brakes, and DC-mediated priming is
the ignition that starts the car. You can accelerate a
car by releasing the brakes, but only when the car is
already running. Likewise, without DC activation in
the tumour, there is no T-cell priming, and ICBs will
not have any eﬀect. Indeed, the major reasons for
resistance to ICBs are a lack of DCs in the tumour or
defects in DC activation [5,9]. Therefore, triggering
robust DC activation would be a breakthrough in can-
cer immunotherapy that would help overcome the
limitations of ICBs.
DCs: A key player in priming anti-cancer
immunity
DCs were ﬁrst identiﬁed by Ralph Steinman, who won
the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. These
cells were named based on their unique morphology,
with dendritic structures that they use to dynamically
probe their environment [8]. DCs reside in all tissues
and act as sentinel cells. They express pattern recog-
nition receptors (PRRs), which they use to sense
abnormalities in their environment. There are two
types of molecular patterns recognised by PRRs
expressed by DCs [19]. Pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) are expressed by microbes such as
bacteria and viruses, but not by host cells. Danger-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), on the other
hand, are biomolecules that are typically expressed
within host cells but are released when cells are
damaged or dying. Virus-infected cells and cancer
cells release DAMPs to induce local inﬂammation
and immune responses. Therefore, DCs sense tissue
damage as well as infections in the peripheral tissues
using PRRs. Signals transduced through PRRs lead to
2

activation of the DCs. Activated DCs up-regulate C–C
chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7), which allows them
to migrate to the LNs, where they can prime T-cells.
In addition to their roles as sentinel cells sensing
pathogen invasion and tissue damage, DCs are anti-
gen-presenting cells (APCs) that capture antigens in
the peripheral tissue and present them to T-cells in
the LNs [3]. DCs engulf microbes and cancer cells,
break their proteins down into short peptide antigens,
and present these antigenic peptides on their surface
within major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mol-
ecules. T-cells expressing T-cell receptors (TCRs)
speciﬁc for the antigenic peptides presented by DCs
become primed. These primed T-cells then undergo
clonal proliferation, diﬀerentiate into eﬀector T-cells,
and migrate to infected/tumour tissues to eliminate
microbes/cancer cells.
Key signals for DCs to prime cancer-speciﬁc T-
cells
As mentioned above, DCs must receive the proper sig-
nals to prime cancer-speciﬁc T-cells. Two distinct sig-
nals, such as cancer antigens and ligands for PRRs, are

required. Indeed, cancer cells themselves contain both
signals. Cancer antigens are proteins speciﬁcally
expressed
in cancer cells, and all cells express
DAMPs. Therefore, whole cancer cells can be used to
generate
DCs
for
priming
anti-cancer
immune
responses. A number of diﬀerent methods to prepare
dying/dead cancer cells or their lysates have been
developed to maximise immunogenicity [20]. How-
ever, whole cancer cell-based approaches have demon-
strated limited clinical eﬃcacy, presumably due to
ineﬃcient presentation of cancer-speciﬁc antigens
and DAMPs [21].
Biomaterial-based synthetic platforms presenting
cancer antigens and key molecules for DC activation
would allow us to optimise immunogenicity and deli-
ver the stimulatory molecules under the proper physio-
logical context. In this section, the key signaling
molecules involved in DC activation and priming of
cancer-speciﬁc immune responses are summarised.
Then, in the following chapters, detailed biomaterial-
based strategies for the assembly and release of these
signaling molecules are reviewed.
The ﬁrst signal that needs to be delivered for DCs to
prime cancer-speciﬁc T-cells is the cancer antigen.
There are two types of cancer antigens that can be tar-
geted for immunotherapy [22,23]. tumour-associated
antigens (TAAs) are expressed at low levels in normal
cells but high levels in cancer cells. Neoantigens, on the
other hand, are only expressed in cancer cells. TAAs
have been major targets for cancer therapy until
recently, as identiﬁcation of neoantigens is technically
challenging. However, advances in genome sequencing
technology and deep learning-based prediction algor-
ithms now allow neoantigens to be predicted with
reasonable precision. Therefore, neoantigen-based can-
cer targeting would enable personalised treatment of
cancers, as neoantigens are mostly patient-speciﬁc.
Once cancer antigens are identiﬁed, they can be formu-
lated into many diﬀerent types of biomolecules. Cancer
antigens are derived from proteins expressed by cancer
cells that are presented by DCs as short peptides, typi-
cally 8–10 mers, and thus they can be delivered to DCs
as proteins or short peptides. Alternatively, DNA or
mRNA that encodes information about cancer antigens
could be used. As proteins are expensive to synthesise,
and DNA-based vaccines are ineﬃcient, peptides and
mRNAs are the two major formats being used for can-
cer antigen delivery [21].
The second signal required for DCs to prime anti-
cancer immune responses is an activation signal,
which can be provided by an adjuvant. DCs can be acti-
vated by various factors such as PAMPs derived from
microorganisms, DAMPs released by dying cells,
CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on activated T-cells,
inﬂammatory cytokines, and other endogenous ligands
(Table 1). In particular, ligands for Toll-like receptors
(TLRs), a major class of PRRs for various PAMPs
and DAMPs, have been used to augment anti-cancer
immune responses. For example, polyinosicin-polycy-
tidylic acid with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose
(poly-ICLC) [24], monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)
[25], imiquimod, resiquimod (R-848) [26], and CpG
oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) [26] have been
used as agonists for TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR7/8, and
TLR9, respectively. Agonistic antibodies for CD40
can mimic CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on acti-
vated T-cells and activate DCs synergistically with
TLR agonists [27]. Additionally, granulocyte-macro-
phage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [28], a
critical cytokine for DC generation and activation,
and
agonists for
stimulator of
interferon
genes
(STING) [29], such as cyclic dinucleotide derivatives
and cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate, which induce
type I interferon production, are widely used adjuvants
for DC activation. In the absence of activation signals,
DCs induce immune tolerance rather than immune
responses. Proper presentation of immune adjuvants
to DCs is therefore indispensable for successful cancer
immunotherapy.

uptake of dying cancer cells by DCs. Therefore, con-
ventional cancer therapeutics that directly kill cancer
cells can be combined with cancer immunotherapy if
they induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) [30]. To
achieve this goal, cytotoxic therapies should be deliv-
ered ﬁrst, to maximise cancer cell death and minimise
normal tissue damage. Then, immune-based strategies
could be used to overcome the immunosuppressive
tumour microenvironment (TME) and to prime strong
anti-cancer immune responses. In this section, various
biomaterial-based strategies to deliver cancer thera-
peutics to tumour tissues to prime strong anti-cancer
immune responses will be reviewed. Speciﬁcally, nano-
materials designed to induce ICD of cancer cells, and
biocompatible scaﬀolds designed to release various
therapeutics
to
overcome
immunosuppression
in
TME and maximise immune priming will be described
in detail.
Nanoparticles for inducing ICD of cancer cells
Biomaterial-based strategies to maximise ICD and
minimise side eﬀects
To induce ICD, suﬃcient amounts of DAMPs need to
be released by dying cancer cells to trigger local inﬂam-
mation in the tumour. In addition, damage to immune
cells by the therapy should be minimised. Conventional
cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiother-
apy, have been developed mainly to maximise cancer
cell killing. Because these therapies target rapidly divid-
ing cells, which includes immune cells, conventional
cancer therapies tend to weaken patients’ immune sys-
tems [31,32]. Biomaterial-based strategies are ideal to
address this issue by delivering cytotoxic reagents
directly to cancer cells, thus minimising eﬀects on the
immune system (Figure 3(a)). NPs can be delivered
directly to cancer cells by attaching binder molecules
that speciﬁcally target cancer cells, such as antibodies
and aptamers (Figure 3(b)) [33,34]. In addition, pay-
loads encapsulated in NPs can be released within can-
cer cells using NPs that release their cargo under
certain conditions, such as low pH (Figure 3(c)) [34–
36].
In addition to speciﬁcally killing cancer cells, it is
important to subsequently trigger strong anti-cancer
immune responses. DAMPs released by dying cancer
cells play an essential role in priming strong anti-can-
cer immune responses by recruiting DCs and activating
them to eﬃciently present cancer antigens to T-cells.
For example, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acts as a
‘ﬁnd me’ signal to recruit DCs to dying cancer cells
[37]; calreticulin (CRT) serves as an ‘eat me’ signal to
encourage engulfment of dying/dead cancer cells
[38]; and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) pro-
motes antigen presentation by DCs [39]. Two strategies
have been devised to maximise ICD. First, cancer anti-
gens and DAMPs released by dying/dead cancer cells
are captured by nanomaterials and presented to DCs
to prevent their loss by diﬀusion (Figure 3(d)) [40–
42]. Second, additional signals that stimulate local
immune responses, such as TLR agonists, are incorpor-
ated into the nanomaterials (Figure 3(e)) [43–48].
With these principles, detailed examples of how
nanomaterials are being utilised to maximise ICD
mediated by conventional cancer therapies, as well as
light-responsive nanomaterials that induce ICD with
irradiation in light-illuminated areas, will be described
in the following sections.
Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of
chemotherapeutics
Chemotherapeutics can either attenuate the immune
system or boost anti-cancer immunity, depending on
their mode of action [49]. NP-based delivery of some
chemotherapeutics demonstrated eﬀective induction
of ICD, resulting in anti-cancer immunity (Figure 4
(a)). Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used cancer
therapy and has frequently been used to induce ICD
in conjunction with NP-mediated delivery [50–52].
Speciﬁcally, DOX conjugated with hyaluronic acid
(HA) via acid-degradable linkage (HA-DOX) was
coated onto nanocores composed of the TLR7/8 ago-
nist R848 encapsulated in poly(L-histidine) (PHIS)
and was used to treat mice with 4T1 breast tumours
(Figure 4(b)) [53]. The core–shell NPs were stable in
the bloodstream and normal tissue, but dissociated in
slightly acidic environments (pH of approximately
6.5), such as the TME, because the PHIS became
ionised, resulting in the release of HA-DOX and
R848. HA-DOX was preferentially taken up by breast
cancer cells overexpressing CD44, a receptor for HA,
and the acid-degradable linker connecting HA-DOX
was degraded in endo/lysosomes (pH of approximately
5.5), resulting in DOX delivery into the breast cancer
cells. In addition to inducing ICD of breast cancer
cells, R848 triggered local inﬂammation by activating
DCs expressing TLR7/8, and thus both reagents syner-
gistically inhibited tumour growth. DOX has also been
attached to synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL)-
mimicking nanodiscs to minimise oﬀ-target side eﬀects
and trigger ICD (Figure 4(c)) [51]. Cancer cells treated
with sHDL-DOX upregulated CRT and released
HMGB1 to activate local DCs and trigger cancer cell
uptake. In combination with an antibody against pro-
grammed death 1 (anti-PD-1), which is an ICB,
sHDL-DOX -loaded nanodiscs completely eradicated
colon carcinomas from 80% of mice and prevented
tumour recurrence.
Oxaliplatin (OXA) is another clinically used che-
motherapeutic known to induce ICD. When magnetic
nanoparticles coated with tumour-targeting and OXA-
bearing polymers were used in the 4T1 breast cancer
model, the particles actively accumulated at tumour
sites and released ferric ions and OXA (Figure 4(d))

[54]. Ferric ions triggered ROS generations that syner-
gise ICD induction by OXA, resulting in enhanced
exposure of DAMPs. Additionally, the magnetic nano-
particles that accumulated at the tumour sites were
used as a highly sensitive magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) contrast agent.
Nanomaterials enhancing ICD by radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is routinely used in cancer therapy based
on high energy ionising radiation [55]. Irradiation gen-
erates free radicals that damage cellular components,
including DNA, to induce cancer cell death [56].
Interestingly, radiotherapy can trigger the regression
of tumours that are distant from the irradiated area.
This abscopal eﬀect is primarily due to anti-cancer
immune responses caused by radiation-mediated ICD
[57].
Diverse NPs have been used to enhance the thera-
peutic eﬃcacy of radiotherapy and reduce side eﬀects
caused by high-dose irradiation (Figure 5(a)) [58,59].
Importantly, high-dose radiation not only ablates can-
cer cells but also damages normal cells, resulting in
immunosuppression that potentially interferes with
the abscopal eﬀect [31,32]. To overcome this issue,

NPs that can sensitise cancer cells to undergo cell death
under low-dose radiation, including gold- [60], gadoli-
nium- [61], hafnium- [62,63], and titanium-based NPs
[64,65], have been developed. Targeted delivery of
these nanomaterials to cancer cells can increase the
accumulation of radiation energy within the TME,
thus allowing the use of a lower dose of radiation. Radi-
ation can directly damage cancer cells through various
biochemical pathways [66,67] and lead to the gener-
ation of ROS to eliminate radiation-resistant cancer
cells [68]. A porous nanoscale metal–organic frame-
work (nMOF) based on hafnium (Hf)/porphyrin-
based photosensitiser loaded with an inhibitor for
indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase
(IDOi),
an
immunosuppressive enzyme, induced an abscopal
eﬀect with low-dose X-ray irradiation, leading to
local and distal tumour regression in breast and color-
ectal cancer models (Figure 5(b)) [63]. Mechanistically,
Hf clusters in nMOF promoted X-ray photons absorp-
tion to generate radicals (radiotherapy) and to excite
photosensitisers (radiodynamic therapy), resulting in
ICD of tumour cells with minimal X-ray dose. Release
of IDOi loaded in porous nMOF further enhanced
anti-cancer immune responses by inhibiting immuno-
suppressive enzyme IDO. PLGA core–shell NPs loaded
with a catalase in core and imiquimod (R837) in the
PLGA shell, a TLR7 agonist, signiﬁcantly enhanced
the eﬃcacy of radiotherapy in breast and colorectal

H2O2,
thus
substantially
alleviated
hypoxia, whereas R837 loaded in the shell of NPs trig-
gered TLR7/8 signaling to activate DCs to eﬃciently
mount anti-cancer immune responses.
Light-responsive nanomaterials
Light-responsive NPs have been developed for cancer
therapy, as some NPs absorb light and generate local
heat or ROS, which can be used to kill cancer cells [70–
72]. Cancer therapies based on light-mediated heat or
ROS generation, so-called photothermal or photody-
namic therapy, respectively, have recently been com-
bined with immunotherapy, as they can also trigger
anti-cancer immune responses (Figure 6(a)) [73,74].
In photothermal therapy, locally administrated light is
converted to heat by light-responsive nanomaterials, lead-
ing to a local temperature increase. The typical target
temperature for photothermal therapy is 40–45°C,
which is known to kill cancer cells by denaturing proteins
and inducing cellular programmes for cell death [75]. In
addition, hyperthermia can trigger immune responses
that promote anti-cancer immunity [76]. To generate
light-induced heating in the TME, inorganic NPs that
absorb near-infrared (NIR) light and eﬃciently convert
it to heat (e.g. gold [77,78], graphene oxide [79,80], and
copper sulphide [81–83]) are delivered to the tumour.
NIR light is preferentially used in light-responsive nano-
materials because it has optimal tissue penetration with
minimal light scattering and tissue absorption [84,85].
Photothermal ablation of the tumour not only directly
kills cancer cells, but also induces the release of cancer
antigens and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, promoting
anti-cancer immune responses.
To
further
enhance
the
anti-cancer
immune
responses induced by photothermal therapy, immune
adjuvants such as TLR agonists or ICBs are frequently

added. For instance, hollow copper sulphide nanoparti-
cles coated with CpG ODN have been used in the EMT6
mouse model of mammary carcinoma (Figure 6(b))
[86]. NIR irradiation initiated copper sulphide-mediated
photothermal ablation, resulting in ICD of cancer cells
and priming of anti-cancer immune responses, and the
release of CpG ODN further enhanced local immune
responses in the tumour tissue. Photothermal therapy
based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in
combination with a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
(CTLA-4) antibody eﬀectively ablated primary tumours
and inhibited metastasis in mice inoculated with 4T1
breast cancer cells [87]. Notably, SWNT itself activated
DCs to upregulate activation receptors such as CD80
and CD86, and to secret inﬂammatory cytokines such
as TNF-a, IL-20, and IL-6, further enhancing ICD
induced by photothermal NIR irradiation.
Photodynamic therapy utilises a photosensitiser (e.g.
hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion radicals, singlet
oxygen) that generates ROS upon light illumination
[88]. Nanomaterials have been employed as carriers of
photosensitisers or as new types of photosensitisers

with unique optical properties [89]. Like photothermal
therapy, photodynamic therapy can also trigger anti-
cancer immunity by inducing ICD of cancer cells and
stimulating local immune responses.
For instance, graphene oxide loaded with photo-
chlor [2-(1-hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophor-
bide-α], a hydrophobic photosensitiser, (GO(HPPH))
by hydrophobic and π-π stacking triggered strong
anti-cancer immune responses that suppressed tumour
growth and lung metastasis in mice with 4T1 tumours
[90]. Photodynamic therapy mediated by GO(HPPH)
successfully induced DC activation in tumour draining
lymph nodes, and suppressed distal tumour growth.

Biocompatible scaﬀolds for sustained priming
In the previous section, NPs targeting tumour tissues to
prime anti-cancer immunity were reviewed. NPs can
induce ICD and stimulate local immune responses,
but delivering suﬃcient amounts of NPs to the tumour
is technically challenging. Typically, less than 1% of
NPs infused intravenously reach the tumour, whereas
the majority of NPs either accumulate in other tissues,
such as the liver and spleen, or are cleared in the kidney
[92]. NPs can be directly injected into tumours, but
intratumoural administration is only possible for a
few cancers, such as skin cancer, where the tumour is
directly accessible, and is not possible for the majority
of tumours. One exception to this occurs during sur-
gery to remove a tumour mass. Scaﬀolds that are
implanted surgically into the tissue where the tumour
was resected have been recently developed to prime
local anti-cancer immune responses by the controlled
release of immunotherapeutics (Figure 7(a)).
Surgery is the most frequently used treatment with
the longest history in cancer therapy. Surgical resection
of the tumour can enhance the eﬃcacy of immunother-
apy by eliminating the immunosuppressive microen-
vironment. However, tumour-reactive immune cells
and tumour antigens are also removed, making it
diﬃcult to induce anti-tumour immune responses.
Furthermore, upon surgery, the tissue undergoes a
wound healing process, temporarily resulting in an
immunosuppressive local environment. Consequently,
surgical removal of the tumour often causes recurrence
and metastasis, which accounts for 90% of cancer
deaths [93]. To address this problem, biomaterials
releasing immune stimulators over a prolonged period
of time are applied to the surgical site in the form of
preformed scaﬀolds [94–96] and injectable [97,98] or
sprayed [99] hydrogels.
Hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel scaﬀolds containing
various immune stimulators were implanted into
tumour-resected mouse models to identify key signals
to prevent tumour recurrence and metastasis (Figure 7
(b)) [94]. Implanted hydrogels that locally release ago-
nists of TLR7/8 or STING in a sustained manner
induced the best therapeutic outcomes by recruiting
immune cells, including DCs and T-cells, to the surgical
sites and activating them. Porous scaﬀolds loaded with
DOX, a chemotherapeutic inducing ICD, and PLGA
nanoparticles containing R848, a TLR7/8 agonist, were
implanted in surgical sites and primed anti-cancer
immune responses by inducing ICD, and further
ampliﬁed anti-cancer immune responses by R848-
mediated conversion of immunosuppressive cells to
immune-stimulatory cells in the TME (Figure 7(c))
[96]. When combined with anti-PD-1 ICB, these
scaﬀolds prevented tumour recurrence and metastasis.
Fibrin gels loaded with calcium carbonate nanopar-
ticles containing an anti-CD47 antibody, which pro-
motes engulfment of cancer cells by phagocytes, such
as DCs and macrophages, by blocking a ‘don’t eat
me’ signal [100], were formed by spraying (Figure 7
(d)) [99]. Dissolution of the nanoparticles released cal-
cium carbonate into the TME, which scavenged H+ to
neutralise the acidic local pH, which is immunosup-
pressive, and released anti-CD47 to enhance cancer
cell phagocytosis and antigen presentation.
Biomaterials for priming anti-cancer
immune responses from peripheral tissues
The biomaterial-based strategies described in the pre-
vious chapter are mainly based on inducing ICD of
cancer cells in the tumour and stimulating local
immune responses. These strategies are powerful, as
cancer antigens in tumours are directly used to prime
immune responses, abrogating the need to identify can-
cer antigens. However, directly targeting the tumour is
technically challenging, as tumours are mostly located
in internal organs only accessible by invasive surgery,
and only a fraction of NPs injected into the blood
reach the tumour. In addition, priming strong immune
responses in the tumour is technically challenging due
to immune suppression in the TME. To overcome
these
limitations,
strategies
to
prime
anti-cancer
immune responses in the peripheral tissues have been
devised, as T-cells activated in peripheral LNs can
migrate to the tumour through the bloodstream.
10

However, these approaches, known as cancer vaccines,
have shown poor therapeutic eﬃcacy [21].
To induce ample anti-tumour immune responses,
immunomodulatory
compounds,
including
cancer
antigens and adjuvants, must be eﬀectively delivered
to DCs in the peripheral tissues or draining lymphoid
organs. Biomaterial-based strategies allow for con-
trolled delivery of key signals to DCs located in either
the peripheral tissue or the draining LNs, and thus
can overcome the limitations of conventional cancer
vaccines by maximising eﬃcacy and minimising side
eﬀects. Similar to biomaterials targeting tumour tis-
sues, NPs and biocompatible scaﬀolds that release
immune modulators have been used to promote anti-
cancer immune responses in the peripheral tissues.
Nanoparticle-based cancer vaccines
DC-targeting NPs containing cancer antigens and
adjuvants have been administrated in the peripheral
tissues as cancer vaccines [101,102]. NPs are ideal plat-
forms for cancer vaccines, as their physicochemical
properties can be ﬁne-tuned to optimise speciﬁc deliv-
ery to DCs, to maximise eﬃcacy and minimise side
eﬀects (Figure 8). In addition, some NPs themselves
serve as adjuvants that can further enhance anti-cancer
immune responses.
NP-based cancer vaccines can either target tissue-
resident DCs, which migrate to the LNs upon acti-
vation, or LN-resident DCs. NPs injected into the per-
ipheral tissue can remain in the tissues, ﬂow through
the capillaries to enter the circulation, or drain into
Figure 7. Postsurgical biocompatible scaﬀold-based strategies priming local anti-cancer immune responses. (a) HA-based/porous

the lymphatics to the reach LNs, depending on their
size and surface charge [103]. Therefore, to precisely
target DCs, we ﬁrst need to understand the transport
of NPs injected into the peripheral tissues.
NP size plays a predominant role in their transport
in the peripheral tissue. NPs greater than 100 nm in
size tend to become entrapped in the peripheral tissue
due to their limited diﬀusion. Although it depends on
the type of capillary and its vascular tight junction
[104], NPs less than 10 nm in size are generally
absorbed in the capillaries. However, NPs that are
between 10 and 100 nm drain through the lymphatics
because they are small enough to be transported within
the interstitium but are too large to access the blood
vessels [105]. Thus, NPs greater than 100 nm are typi-
cally used to target DCs in the peripheral tissues, and
NPs between 10 and 100 nm in size are optimal for tar-
geting LN-resident DCs. The surface charge of the NPs
is another important factor, as the interstitium is nega-
tively charged. Typically, positively charged NPs exhi-
bit poorer transport through the interstitium than
neutral or negatively charged NPs.
NPs targeting the DCs in peripheral tissues
NPs that remain in the peripheral tissue can be
engulfed by phagocytic cells, but only DCs can prime
strong anti-cancer immune responses. The number of
DCs present in the peripheral tissue is relatively low
compared
with
other
phagocytic
cells,
such
as
macrophages, so strategies for speciﬁcally targeting
DCs are important [101,106].
To deliver NPs to DCs, various receptors expressed
on DCs such as mannose receptors, DEC-205, CD11c,
CD40, and DC-SIGN (CD209) can be speciﬁcally tar-
geted (Figure 8(a)) [102]. Nanomaterials have been
coated with mannose or mannan to improve DC tar-
geting [107,108]. Anti-DEC205-conjugated NPs exhib-
ited enhanced uptake by DCs and consequently
induced strong immune responses [109]. Recently,
anti-DC-SIGN-conjugated porous silicon NPs were
used to eﬀectively deliver immunomodulatory agents
to human DCs [110,111]. Interestingly, multiple DC-
targeting ligands combined on PLGA NPs substantially
enhanced immune responses by triggering activation of
heterogeneous subsets of DCs [112].
In addition to attaching NPs to DC ligands, DC tar-
geting can be enhanced by optimising the physico-
chemical properties of NPs, such as their size, surface
properties, and shape. NPs less than 500 nm in diam-
eter induced stronger immune response than larger
NPs [113,114]. Positively charged gold NPs were
engulfed by DCs more eﬀectively than negatively
charged ones [115]. Hydrophobic NPs can also trigger
strong immune responses by acting as DAMPs
[116,117]. Indeed, the ability of amphiphilic poly(γ-
glutamic
acid)-g-L-phenylalanine
nanoparticles
to
deliver antigen and activate DCs increased as the
hydrophobicity of the side chains increased [118].
The shape of the NPs can also aﬀect their recognition

oped to target DCs. (a) NPs were developed to target DCs in peripheral tissues by modifying DC targeting ligands or optimising
physicochemical properties. (b) NPs were developed to directly target lymph nodes by optimising physicochemical properties.

and internalisation by DCs. For example, rod-shaped
gold NPs displayed higher uptake by DCs than spheri-
cal NPs of the same size [119].
NPs directly targeting lymph nodes (LNs)
LNs are the location of T-cell priming by antigens pre-
sented by DCs. DCs residing in the LNs collect antigens
draining through the lymphatics and present them to
T-cells to prime immune responses. Therefore, LN-
resident DCs are good targets for cancer immunother-
apy. Generally, nanoparticles with a size of 10–100 nm
and a neutral or anionic surface charge drain to the
LNs when they are injected into peripheral tissues
(Figure 8(b)) [103]. PEGylation of nanomaterials can
further enhance LN targeting by minimising nanopar-
ticle–ECM interactions, as has been shown with poly
(methacrylic acid) (PMA) NPs [120]. However, PEGy-
lation may reduce the retention of NPs in the LNs and
prevent NP engulfment by DCs [121]. PEG-phos-
phoethanolamine (PEG-PE) and PEG-polyethyleni-
mine-stearic acid (PSA) conjugates formed polymer
hybrid micelles through hydrophobicity and electro-
static interactions, which were delivered to LNs to
induce strong anti-tumour responses [122]. In addition
to using nanomaterials with controlled sizes and sur-
faces, NPs can be designed to ‘hitchhike’ with proteins
in the peripheral tissue that drain to the LNs, such as
albumin, to target LN-resident DCs [123].
Biocompatible scaﬀolds for recruiting and
educating DCs
As mentioned in the previous section, priming strong
anti-cancer immune responses by targeting DCs in
the peripheral tissues is technically challenging because
the number of DCs in the peripheral tissue is low com-
pared with the number of macrophages. Therefore,
macroscopic scaﬀolds that recruit DCs, and deliver
cancer antigens and DC activation signals are an attrac-
tive strategy because the number of activated DCs can
be maximised (Figure 9(a)) [124]. David Mooney pio-
neered this idea by adapting scaﬀolds developed for tis-
sue regeneration [125,126]. Porous scaﬀolds implanted
in peripheral tissues attracted and educated DCs to
promote anti-cancer immune responses by other
immune cells. Various scaﬀolds that release DC-
attracting molecules, cancer antigens, and immune
adjuvants have been developed.
Polymeric scaﬀolds
Porous PLGA scaﬀolds, which are similar in shape to
those used in conventional tissue engineering, have
been designed to contain cancer antigens, CpG ODN,
and GM-CSF (Figure 9(b)) [125]. GM-CSF released
from the scaﬀolds induced the recruitment of DCs
into the scaﬀolds. DCs in the scaﬀolds that take up can-
cer antigens become activated by CPG ODN and
migrate to LNs. A PLGA scaﬀold-based cancer vaccine
implanted in tumour-bearing mice primed strong anti-
cancer immune responses and improved the survival of
the mice by 50% compared with the control groups.
Polymeric scaﬀolds are versatile platforms that can be
designed to incorporate multiple bioactive compounds
and release them in a controlled manner by selecting
the type and molecular weight of the polymer consti-
tuting the scaﬀold. They can thus be optimised for
the delivery of diﬀerent types of cancer antigens, DC-
recruiting factors, and adjuvants. For example, DC-
recruiting chemokines other than GM-CSF, such as
CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) and FMS-related
tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), have also been incor-
porated into this type of scaﬀold [126]. In addition,
various types of cancer antigens, including peptide
neoantigens and cancer cell lysates, can be loaded
onto the scaﬀold to treat various types of cancer. This
technology is currently being evaluated in clinical trials
in the United States (NCT01753089) and has been
licensed to Novartis.
Injectable inorganic scaﬀolds
The biocompatible polymeric scaﬀolds described in
the previous section are invasive because surgery is
required for implantation. To avoid the need for sur-
gical implantation of polymer scaﬀolds, injectable
scaﬀolds have recently been developed (Figure 9(c))
[127]. MSRs with high aspect ratios are ideal for this
application because cancer antigens and adjuvants
can be loaded within their porous structures, and
they
can
self-assemble
into
macroscopic
porous
scaﬀolds upon injection to provide space for DC
entry. Indeed, mesoporous silica has been widely
used for drug delivery due to its biocompatibility,
high pore volume, and large surface area [128–130].
Upon
injection
into
the
peripheral
tissues
of
tumour-bearing mice, the porous silica rods formed
scaﬀolds releasing GM-CSF to recruit DCs, and deliv-
ered CpG ODN and cancer antigens to DCs within
the scaﬀolds, resulting in strong anti-cancer immune
responses and improved survival in a mouse model
of lymphoma. The anti-cancer immune responses
induced by the MSR scaﬀolds were further enhanced
by coating the scaﬀolds with the cationic polymer
polyethylenimine (PEI), which functions as an adju-
vant to trigger pro-inﬂammatory cytokine secretion,
resulting in the eradication of large established
tumours [131]. Injectable hydrogels, such as sponge-
like macroporous cryogels [132–134], are also used
for peripheral vaccination.
Conclusions and future perspectives
Various biomaterial-based strategies for priming anti-
cancer immune responses developed over the last dec-
ade were extensively reviewed with an emphasis on the
INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS REVIEWS
13
principles underlying their design. Overall, biomater-
ials have been successfully used to induce anti-cancer
immune responses in preclinical models, mostly in
mice, by allowing controlled delivery of various immu-
nostimulatory molecules. Translating the therapeutic
strategies that have been successful in mice to human
patients is currently under way. Biomaterials must be
approved for use in humans by regulatory agencies
such as the Federal Drug Administration (FDA); thus
using biomaterials approved by FDA for other clinical
applications may be is a good strategy to facilitate clini-
cal translation.
Priming anti-cancer immune responses is necessary,
but not suﬃcient, to cure cancer, as many other steps in
the cancer-immunity cycle may inhibit anti-cancer
immune responses. Therefore, combining the bioma-
terial-based strategies for priming immune responses
with other strategies, including ICBs as described in a
number of examples in this review, is likely to enhance
their therapeutic eﬃcacy. Personalised combination
strategies would be desirable as each cancer patient
exhibit distinct cancer-immune set point, or immuno-
logical status of anti-cancer immunity [135]. In
addition, personalised cancer antigens can be used
for each patient to maximise anti-cancer immune
responses with the advancement of neoantigen predic-
tion technology [136,137]. Biomaterials could play a
critical role in personalised combination immunother-
apy, as the location and timing of delivery are key fac-
tors for combining diﬀerent types of therapeutics.
