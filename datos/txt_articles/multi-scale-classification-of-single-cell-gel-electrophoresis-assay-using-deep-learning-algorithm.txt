 Introduction
Deoxyribonucleic
 acid
 (DNA),
 the
 hereditary
 material
 of
 the
 cell,
is
 the
 polymer
 of
 deoxyribonucleotide
 subunits
 [1].
 Structural
 and
functional
 integrity
 of
 DNA
 is
 crucial
 for
 the
 maintenance
 of
 heredi-
tary
 information.
 However,
 by-products
 of
 cellular
 metabolism
 and
physical
 or
 chemical
 factors
 may
 cause
 spontaneous
 DNA
 damage
[2].
 Such
 DNA
 lesions
 can
 inhibit
 replication
 and
 transcription.
 In
consequence,
 unrepaired
 lesions
 may
 lead
 to
 lethal
 mutations
 or
large-scale
 genomic
 errors
 that
 threaten
 cellular
 metabolism
 and
organism.
DNA
 damage
 analysis,
 in
 addition
 to
 information
 about
 the
pathophysiology
 of
 the
 disease,
 provides
 important
 information
 on
the
 early
 biological
 effects
 of
 exposure
 to
 occupationally
 harmful
chemicals
 [3].
 Besides,
 DNA
 damage
 detection
 is
 used
 in
 the
 ﬁelds
 of
ecotoxicology,
 molecular
 epidemiology,
 and
 genotoxicology.
 There
are
 different
 methods
 to
 evaluate
 DNA
 damage.
 Amongst,
 comet
assay
 or
 single-cell
 gel
 electrophoresis
 is
 the
 widely
 used
 and
accepted
 analysis.
 The
 method
 is
 based
 on

tion
 of
 the
 electrophoretic
 mobility
 of
 DNA
 obtained
 from
 a
 single
cell
 and
 its
 nucleus.
 In
 general,
 DNA
 and/or
 intact
 nucleus
 is
 iso-
lated,
 and
 embedded
 in
 thin
 layers
 of
 agarose
 gel
 on
 a
 slide.
 The
 DNA
in
 the
 agarose
 gel
 layers
 is
 moved
 in
 an
 alkaline
 electrophoretic
environment.
 In
 alkaline
 media,
 the
 chromatin
 structure
 opens,
and
 the
 DNA
 is
 partially
 denatured.
 Because
 of
 the
 effect
 of
 geno-
toxic
 factors,
 single
 and/or
 double-strand
 DNA
 breaks
 and
 DNA
fragments
 of
 different
 molecular
 weights
 occur.
 Following
 elec-
trophoresis,
 the
 DNA
 in
 the
 gel
 is
 labeled
 with
 a
 ﬂuorescent
 DNA
speciﬁc
 dye
 like
 ethidium
 bromide
 or
 silver-stained
 and
 observed
by
 a
 microscope.
 Intact
 supercoiled
 chromatin
 DNA

slowly

 under
 the
 microscope.
 Depending
on
 the
 extent
 of
 damage,
 DNA
 fragments
 of
 varying
 sizes
 move
 at
differentially
 with
 respect
 to
 their
 molecular
 weight.
 This
 results
in
 a
 form
 similar
 to
 a
 “comet”
 in
 ﬂuorescence
 microscope
 images
[2,4,5].
Comet
 assay
 analysis
 is
 the
 most
 used
 method
 in
 genotoxic
studies
 due
 to
 its
 high
 sensitivity.
 This
 method
 also
 enables
 the
detection
 of
 DNA
 damage
 in
 small
 sample
 sizes.
 Besides,
 it
 is
 cheap,
reproducible
 method
 with
 short
 protocol
 duration
 [3].
 Comet
 assay
images
 are
 visually
 scored
 by
 expert
 researchers
 from
 0
 to
 4
 accord-
ing
 to
 DNA
 damage
 levels.
 However,
 this
 scoring
 needs
 personal
expertise
 and
 it
 may
 give
 subjective
 results.

In
 recent
 years,
 few
 studies
 have
 been
 made
 in
 the
 literature
 on
the
 classiﬁcation
 of
 these
 images
 [3,6–15].
 In
 the
 proposed
 study,
unlike
 from
 the
 literature,
 comet
 scores
 were
 classiﬁed
 using
 the
convolution
 neural
 network
 (CNN)
 method
 as
 a
 deep
 learning
 algo-
rithm.
 Thus,
 objective
 and
 robust
 results
 were
 tried
 to
 be
 obtained
by
 classifying
 the
 comet
 scores
 successfully.
 Also,
 the
 success
 of
the
 deep
 learning
 algorithm
 in
 the
 classiﬁcation
 of
 cell
 images
 was
analyzed.

Detection
 of
 DNA
 damage
 is
 a
 very
 important
 issue
 in
 comet
assay.
 However,
 there
 are
 few
 studies
 about
 fully
 automated
computer-aided

 of

 Furthermore,
 there
 is
no

 or

 in

 to
 measure

 to

 it.
 In
 their

 each

 was
 manually
extracted,
 then
 the

 was
 marked
 with

 [16].

 “CoMat”
 for
 the
 detection
and
 quantiﬁcation
 of
 the
 DNA

 by
 using
 a

 Sreelatha

 developed
 an

 to
analyze

 using

 for

 In
 the

 a
 contrast

method
 is
 used.
 Then
 Gaussian
 ﬁltering
 is
 applied
 to
 the
 contrast-
enhanced
 image.
 After
 that
 Otsu’s
 method
 is
 evaluated
 for
 the
segmentation
 stage.
 The
 comet
 has
 separated
 into
 three
 regions.
These
 regions
 are
 comet
 head,
 tail,
 and
 background.
 In
 this
 method,
the
 edges
 of
 this
 region
 cannot
 be
 deﬁned
 clearly.
 Therefore,
 the
fuzzy-based
 algorithm
 is
 adopted
 for
 clustering
 [20].
 Sreelatha
et.al
 proposed
 a
 shading

 algorithm
 using
 morphologi-
cal

 or
 top-hat
 transformation
 as
 a

 step.
A

 ﬁltering
 is
 applied
 to
 overcome
 the
 problem
 of

 the
 tail

 that
 merged
 with
 the

 Then
 the

 is
 used
 to

 During

 used
 to

 Kızıltan
 et

 proposed
 a
 semi-automatic
 comet
 assay
analysis
 tool
 to
 obtain
 reliable
 and
 accurate
 measurement
 results.
In
 this
 analysis,
 the
 head
 of
 the
 comet
 is
 segmented
 from
 the
 tail
with
 using
 the
 tail
 moment
 [6].
 Gyori
 et
 al.
 developed
 a
 method
to
 detect
 comets
 based
 on
 geometric
 properties.
 They
 also
 tried
 to
segment
 the
 comet
 heads
 using
 image
 intensity.
 Head
 segmenta-
tion
 of
 comet
 is
 done
 for
 lightly
 damage
 or
 no
 tail
 DNA
 since
 heavily
damaged
 cell
 tail
 has
 a
 geometrically
 larger
 area
 than
 the
 head
 [10].
Vojnovic
 et
 al.
 focused
 on
 algorithms,
 based
 on
 delineating
 the
 head
from
 the
 tail
 of
 a
 comet.
 This
 procedure
 allows
 detecting
 very
 low
level
 of
 DNA
 damage.
 For
 this
 purpose,
 a
 threshold
 level
 is
 used
 on
the
 normalized
 image
 to
 determine
 all
 bright
 objects.
 This
 thresh-
old
 level
 is
 calculated
 from
 the
 intensity
 value
 of
 the
 histogram
maximum
 frequency.
 This
 procedure
 can
 segment
 the
 whole
 area
 of
comet
 including
 with
 both
 heads
 and
 tails
 together
 [21].
 Gonzalez
et

 applied
 an
 open-source
 software,
 CellProﬁler,
 to
 analyze
 auto-
matically
 comet
 on
 the
 digital
 image.
 The
 boundary
 of
 the
 comet
is
 determined
 manually.
 Then,
 the
 CellProﬁler
 calculate
 automati-
cally
 the
 measurements
 of
 tail
 and
 head
 areas
 [22].
 Sansone
 et
 al.
developed
 a
 comet
 assay
 analysis
 algorithm
 for
 minimizing
 user
interaction
 and
 for
 getting
 more
 reproducible
 measurements.
 The
developed
 algorithm
 is
 divided
 into
 two
 steps.
 In
 the
 ﬁrst
 step,
 the
comet
 is
 detected
 with
 Gaussian
 ﬁltering
 and
 morphological
 opera-
tor.
 In
 the
 second
 step,
 the
 comet
 is
 segmented
 as
 head,
 halo,
 and
 tail
with
 fuzzy
 clustering
 to
 identify
 areas
 [7].
 Helma
 et
 al.
 proposed
 an
open-source
 program
 to
 analyze
 the
 comet
 assay
 [12].
 Bocker
 et

described
 an
 automatic
 image
 analysis
 system
 including
 software
and
 hardware
 together
 to
 get
 minimum
 human
 interactions.
 The
comet
 assay
 image
 analysis
 is
 evaluated
 in
 a
 two-step.
 These
 are

The

 used
 in

 were
 obtained
 from

 Cell

 were
 obtained
 by
ﬂuorescence

 (Nikon,

 500

 at

 were
 analyzed.
 Each

 Convolution
 neural
 networks
Deep
 learning
 techniques
 enable
 computers
 to
 detect
 complex
layouts
 in
 large
 data
 sets.
 The
 main
 purpose
 of
 the
 mathematical
models
 created
 by
 deep
 learning
 techniques
 is
 to
 disseminate
 the
learned
 expertise
 and
 to
 convey
 accurate
 predictions
 for
 new
 and
unprecedented
 data.
 An
 artiﬁcial
 neural
 network
 consists
 of
 con-
nected
 and
 arranged
 in
 layers
 called
 neurons.
 These
 layers
 can
 be
listed
 as
 the
 input
 layer
 that
 the
 data
 enter
 into
 the
 network,
 the
hidden
 layers
 that
 convert
 the
 data,
 and
 the
 output
 layer
 that
 pro-
duces
 the
 predictions
 of
 the
 neural
 network.
 One-dimensional
 node
graphs
 of
 these
 structures
 used
 in
 medical
 imaging
 are
 shown
 in
Fig.
 2. The
 interest
 of
 deep
 learning
 in
 medical
 imaging
 is
 usually
performed
 by
 CNN
 [23].
 CNN
 is
 a
 type
 of
 feed-forward
 neural
 net-
works.
 CNN
 is
 applied
 to
 analyze
 visual
 imagery.
 This
 is
 because
CNN
 is
 a
 powerful
 method
 for
 learning
 the
 useful
 representation
 of
images
 and
 other
 structured
 data.
 The
 node
 graph
 applied
 to
 the
medical
 images
 for
 CNN’s
 is
 also
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2d.
 In
 this
 ﬁgure,
the
 blue
 dots
 represent
 the
 entrance,
 the
 orange
 dots
 are
 hidden,
and
 the
 green
 dots
 represent
 the
 output
 layers
 [24].
 CNN,
 a
 speciﬁc
score
 of
 artiﬁcial
 neural
 networks,
 aims
 to
 maintain
 spatial
 rela-
tionships
 in
 the
 data
 with
 very
 little
 connection
 between
 layers.
The
 input
 of
 the
 CNN
 is
 set
 in
 a
 grid
 structure
 and
 then
 sent
 to
 the
layers
 that
 protect
 these
 relationships.
 Each
 layer
 operation
 runs
 in
a
 small
 region
 of
 the
 previous
 layer
 (Fig.
 3).
In
 general,
 comet
 images
 are
 a
 two-dimensional
 matrix.
 How-
ever,
 a
 large
 number
 of
 parameters
 are
 needed
 to
 specify
 a
 network.
CNN
 is
 proposed
 to
 reduce
 these
 parameters
 and
 to
 adapt
 the

 CNN’s
 are
 constructed
 by
 different
 layers.
 These
layers
 differ
 from
 their
 functionalities
 (Fig.
 2).
CNN
 contains
 generally
 three
 layers.
 These
 are
 input,
 an
 output,
and
 multiple
 hidden
 layers.
 The
 hidden
 layers
 are
 typically
 consist-
ing
 of
 four
 different
 types
 of
 layers.
 These
 are
 convolution
 layer,
activation
 layer,
 pooling
 layer,
 and
 fully
 connected
 layer
 [25].
2.2.1.1.
 Convolution
 layer.
 The
 general
 formula
 of
 convolution
operation
 is
 shown
 in
 Eq.
 (1).
s(t)
 =

x (a) w(t
 −
 a)da
 
(1)
Here
 x(t)
 is
 a
 continuous-time
 signal
 and
 w(t)
 is
 time-domain
weighted
 function.
For
 the
 two-dimensional
 image
 I,
 two-dimensional
 kernel
 K
 is
needed
 to
 make
 a
 convolution
 shown
 in
 Eq.
 (2).

 K)
 (i,
 j) =

I (m,

It
 can
 also
 be
 written
 in
 Eq.

S (i,
 j) = (K  ∗
 I)
 (i,
 j) =

m

n
I (i
 −
 m,
 j −
 n) K(m,
 n)

The
 CNN
 input
 is
 a
 matrix
 form.
 The
 dimension
 of
 input
matrix
 is
 (number
 of
 images)
 ×
 (image
 width
 (W))
 ×
 (image
 height
(H))
 ×
 (image
 depth
 (D)).
 Here
 W
 and
 H
 are
 the
 numbers
 of
 con-
volution
 kernels.
 W
 and
 H
 are
 also
 called
 hyper-parameters.
 And
D
 is
 the
 kernel
 depth.
 In
 these
 layers,
 convolution
 operations
 are
applied
 to
 the
 input.
 Then
 the
 result
 is
 the
 input
 of
 the
 next
 layer.
Each
 neuron
 convolution
 processes
 data
 only
 for
 its
 receptive
 ﬁeld.
As
 a
 result,
 huge
 numbers
 of
 neurons
 are
 necessary
 because
 of
 the
large
 input
 sizes
 related
 to
 images
 [26].

 layer.
 This
 activation
 is
 used
 for
 increasing
 the
non-linearity
 of
 CNN
 without
 changing
 the
 receptive
 ﬁelds
 of
 con-
volution
 layer.
 In
 this
 layer
 usually
 Rectiﬁed

 in
 Eq.
 (9), was
used.
 Because,
 CNN
 can
 be
 trained
 much
 faster.
 And
 there
 is
 no
signiﬁcant
 penalty
 to
 generalization
 accuracy
 [27].
f (x) = max(0,  x)
 
(9)
A
 special
 activation
 layer,
 sofmax,
 is
 usually
 used
 at
 the
 end
of
 fully
 connected
 layer
 outputs.
 This
 activation
 layer
 produces
 a
discrete
 probability
 distribution
 vector
 [26].
P (y  =
 jx) =
exT wj
K
k=1exT wk
(10)
Here,
 x
 is
 the
 sample
 input
 vector
 input
 and
 wj is
 vectors
 weight
for
 the
 predicted
 probability
 of
 y
 =
 j.
2.2.1.3.
 Pooling
 layer.
 CNN’s
 pooling
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 non-linear
 down-
sampling.
 There
 are
 lots
 of
 operations
 to
 evaluate
 pooling.
 The
 most
commonly
 used
 operation
 is
 max
 pooling.
 In
 this
 layer,
 the
 input
is
 separated
 into
 non-overlapping
 rectangle
 parts.
 Therefore
 the
pooling
 layer
 will
 reduce
 the
 spatial
 size
 of
 the
 input
 image.
 It
 will
also
 reduce
 the
 number
 of
 parameters,
 memory
 footprint,
 amount
of
 computation
 and
 control
 overﬁtting.
 This
 layer
 separately
 acts
 on
every
 depth
 slice
 of
 the
 input
 and
 resizes
 it
 spatially.
 Generally,
 the
ﬁlter
 sizes
 are
 chosen
 small
 (size
 3
 ×
 3
 or
 5
 ×
 5).
 Larger
 ﬁlter
 sizes
are
 also
 used
 such
 as
 (7
 ×
 7)
 but
 rarely
 and
 only
 in
 the
 ﬁrst
 convolu-
tion
 layer.
 Having
 more
 small
 ﬁlters
 is
 an
 easy
 way
 to
 achieve
 high
representational
 power
 using
 a
 smaller
 number
 of
 parameters.
 It’s
also
 suggested
 to
 use
 a
 small
 stride
 to
 get
 all
 useful
 information
 in
the
 feature
 maps,
 and
 a
 zero-padding
 that
 keeps
 the
 output
 vol-
ume’s
 height
 and
 width
 equivalent
 to
 the
 input
 volume’s
 height
and
 width
 [26].
2.2.1.4.
 Fully
 connected
 (FC)
 layer.
 The
 FC
 layer
 is
 a
 regular
 struc-
ture
 of
 an
 artiﬁcial
 neural
 network.
 It
 is
 usually
 seen
 in
 the
 ﬁnal
learning
 phase.
 This
 layer
 maps
 the
 extracted
 visual
 features
 to
 the
desired
 outputs.
 Classiﬁcations
 can
 be
 done
 in
 this
 layer.
 The
 gen-
eral
 output
 of
 this
 layer
 is
 a
 vector.
 Then
 the
 output
 vector
 is
 the
input
 of
 softmax
 to
 validate
 the
 classiﬁcations.
2.3.
 Performance
 metrics
The
 comet
 assay
 images,
 classiﬁed
 using
 CNN,
 were
 scored
 by
expert
 researchers.
 The
 comet
 assay
 scores
 for
 this
 classiﬁcation
are
 accepted
 as
 the
 gold
 standard.
 Therefore
 the
 performance
 of
the
 CNN
 is
 evaluated
 according
 to
 these
 scores.
 The
 performance
metrics
 of
 the
 CNN
 is
 determined
 with
 calculating
 the
 sensitiv-
ity,
 speciﬁcity
 and
 accuracy
 values.
 These
 metrics
 are
 deﬁned
 as
follows:
Sensitivity
 =
 TP/(TP
 +
 FN)
 
(11)
Speciﬁcity
 =
 TN/(TN
 +
 FP)
 
(12)
Accuracy
 =
 (TP
 +
 TN)/(TP
 +
 TN
 +
 FP
 +
 FN)
 
(13)
Here,
 true
 positive
 (TP)
 is
 the
 number
 of
 true
 classiﬁed
 actual
 comet
assay
 score
 that
 is
 scored
 by
 researchers.
 False-negative
 (FN)
 is
 the
number
 of
 wrongly
 classiﬁed
 comet
 assay
 scores.
 The
 false
 positive
(FP)
 is
 the
 number
 of
 classiﬁcation
 in
 case
 the
 actual
 comet
 assay
score
 is
 determined
 for
 different
 comet
 assay
 scores.
 And
 true
 neg-
ative
 (TN)
 is
 the
 number
 of
 correct
 scored
 images
 while
 there
 is
 no
actual
 comet
 assay
 score
 [28].

 Results
In
 this
 study,
 500
 single-cell
 gel
 electrophoresis
 assay
 images
were
 used;
 equally,
 consist
 of
 ﬁve
 different
 scores.
 The
 representa-
tive
 images
 of
 ﬁve
 different
 comet
 assay
 scores
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.

Fifty
 percent
 of
 all
 images
 were
 used
 for
 training,
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the
images
 were
 used
 for
 testing.
 The
 trained
 images
 were
 not
 used
 for
testing.
 In
 the
 training
 image
 set,
 there
 were
 50
 images
 of
 comet
assay
 score
 0,
 50
 images
 of
 comet
 assay
 score
 1,
 50
 images
 of
 comet
assay
 score
 2,
 50
 images
 of
 comet
 assay
 score
 3,
 and
 50
 images
 of
comet
 assay
 score
 4.
 The
 test
 image
 set
 was
 also
 equally
 distributed.
Each
 image
 has
 was
 annotated
 by
 the
 expert
 researchers
 as
 score
0,
 score
 1,
 score
 2,
 score
 3,
 and
 score
 4.
In
 this
 research,
 various
 ﬁlters
 sized
 and
 numbered
 CNN
 struc-
tures
 were
 trained
 for
 classiﬁcation
 of
 the
 comet
 assay
 scores.
For
 all
 architecture,
 padding
 was
 set
 to
 1,
 and
 the
 stride
 was
set
 to
 2.
 To
 show
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 the
 CNN
 classiﬁcation,
 the
performance
 metrics,
 sensitivity,
 speciﬁcity,
 and
 accuracy,
 were
calculated.

 Discussion
The
 quantitative
 analysis
 of
 the
 comet
 assay
 images
 is
 per-
formed
 manually
 expert
 researchers
 using
 various
 image
 macros
(ImageJ
 etc.).
 Image
 analysis
 software
 is
 used
 to
 calculate
 the
amount
 of
 DNA
 in
 the
 head
 and
 tail,
 and
 the
 length
 of
 the
 tail
is
 also
 measured.
 Different
 software
 metrics
 are
 used
 to
 quantify
DNA
 damage.
 In
 visual
 scoring,
 a
 tail
 moment
 of
 DNA
 is
 expressed
6
 
A.
 Erdamar
 and
 M.F.
 Aksahin
 / Biomedical
 Signal
 Processing
 and
 Control
 56
 (2020)
 101672
as
 arbitrary
 units
 (AU).
 Nuclei
 are
 scored
 as
 0,
 1,
 2,
 3,
 and
 4
 by
 a
blinded
 observer
 according
 to
 the
 apparent
 relative
 proportion
 of
DNA
 in
 the
 tail
 and
 head.
 Each
 counted
 nucleus
 is
 multiplied
 by
its
 score,
 and
 total
 scores
 are
 expressed
 [29].
 The
 most
 important
point
 in
 the
 analysis
 is
 the
 correct
 detection
 of
 the
 comet
 score,
which
 determines
 the
 DNA
 damage.
 This
 determination
 depends
entirely
 on
 the
 visual
 scoring
 and
 professional
 experience
 of
 the
researcher.
 Scoring
 hundreds
 of
 images
 is
 a
 very
 time
 consuming
and
 exhausting
 task.
 Therefore,
 it
 is
 inevitable
 to
 have
 subjective
results.
The
 main
 approach
 in
 previous
 studies
 is
 to
 detect
 DNA
 damage,
to
 obtain
 various
 features
 from
 the
 spatial
 parameters
 of
 the
 image
and
 to
 make
 classiﬁcation
 by
 using
 these
 features.
 In
 these
 studies,
the
 methods
 are
 negatively
 affected
 by
 the
 differences
 in
 image
characteristics.
 For
 example,
 a
 method
 that
 is
 successful
 in
 images
obtained
 with
 gray
 staining
 does
 not
 give
 the
 same
 performance
in
 the
 images
 obtained
 by
 ﬂuorescent
 staining
 since
 the
 silver-
stained
 images
 are
 noisier
 than
 the
 ﬂuorescent
 stained
 images.
Hence,
 regular
 classiﬁcation
 methods
 fail
 to
 effectively
 detect
 the
comet
 scores.
At
 the
 beginning
 of
 this
 study,
 we
 noticed
 that
 the
 ﬂuores-
cent
 stained
 comet
 assay
 images
 had
 variable
 image
 properties
(contrast,
 brightness,
 etc.).
 Differences
 in
 experimental
 setups
 or
conditional
 differences
 among
 the
 laboratories
 could
 be
 the
 pos-
sible
 reasons
 for
 these
 variances.
 Nevertheless,
 this
 is
 a
 major
problem
 for
 a
 conventional
 classiﬁcation
 algorithm
 and
 has
 been
tried
 to
 be
 solved
 by
 various
 pre-processing
 methods
 in
 previous
studies.
 Also,
 agarose
 gel-based
 residues
 cause
 various
 artifacts
 in
images.
 These
 artifacts
 are
 another
 problem
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 over-
come
 for
 image
 analysis
 algorithms.
 In
 order
 to
 solve
 this
 problem,
various
 manual
 add-ons
 could
 be
 applied.
In
 this
 study,
 a
 new
 computer-aided
 classiﬁcation
 method
 is
proposed
 to
 automatically
 detect
 the
 comet
 scores
 using
 a
 deep
learning
 approach
 model.
 It
 was
 shown
 that
 the
 ﬁve
 different
 comet
patterns
 can
 be
 characterized
 by
 the
 CNN
 algorithm.
 There
 is
 no
need
 for
 any
 image
 conditioning
 or
 pre-processing
 step.
 The
 results
show
 that
 this
 classiﬁcation
 method
 is
 robust.
 It
 also
 yields
 repro-
ducible
 results
 for
 different
 scores
 of
 the
 comet
 assay.
 Besides,
 there
is
 no
 human
 interaction
 during
 the
 test
 procedure.
 The
 presented
method
 does
 not
 need
 any
 meta-rules
 or
 any
 kind
 of
 threshold
values.
A
 more
 comprehensive
 comparative
 evaluation
 of
 this
 study
with
 the
 previous
 studies
 is
 not
 feasible
 since
 almost
 all
 similar
studies
 use
 speciﬁc
 comet
 assay
 images
 and
 the
 researcher
 per-
forming
 comet
 analysis
 is
 considered
 as
 the
 gold
 standard
 for
 the
validation.
 Besides,
 there
 is
 not
 any
 study
 using
 the
 CNN
 method
 in
the
 literature.

 Conclusion
In
 proposed
 work,
 a
 deep
 learning-based
 classiﬁcation
 algo-
rithm
 has
 been
 developed
 for
 comet
 (single-cell
 gel
 electrophore-
sis)
 assay
 images.
 The
 CNN
 algorithm
 has
 high
 sensitivity,
speciﬁcity,
 and
 accuracy
 results.
 Scores
 of
 comet
 assay
 images
 are
carried
 out
 by
 expert
 researchers.
 This
 may
 have
 subjective
 conse-
quences,
 and
 also
 may
 differ
 according
 to
 the
 visual
 abilities
 of
 the
experts.
 This
 study
 shows
 that
 with
 the
 high-performance
 scoring
results,
 CNN
 can
 objectively
 determine
 the
 comet
 assay
 scores
 as
 a
deep
 learning
 algorithm.
 Moreover,
 this
 study
 will
 be
 a
 reference
for
 the
 successful
 application
 of
 deep
 learning
 techniques
 to
 classify
other
 kinds
 of
 cell
