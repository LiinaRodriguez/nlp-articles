Title: Novel Biomarkers in Canine Mammary Tumors: A Comprehensive Analysis

Abstract:
Recent advances in molecular diagnostics for canine mammary tumors have revolutionized early detection methods. This study examines novel biomarkers and their potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools. Using next-generation sequencing and proteomics approaches, we identified a panel of molecular markers strongly associated with tumor progression and metastatic potential. The study included 150 cases of canine mammary tumors, representing various histological types and clinical stages.

Methods:
We conducted a prospective study of 150 female dogs diagnosed with mammary tumors between 2020 and 2023. Tissue samples were collected during surgical procedures and analyzed using next-generation sequencing and proteomics. Three specific biomarkers (K9-MT1, K9-MT2, and K9-MT3) were evaluated for their diagnostic and prognostic value.

Results:
The combination of three specific biomarkers achieved 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity in distinguishing malignant from benign tumors. K9-MT1 showed the strongest correlation with metastatic potential (p < 0.001), while K9-MT2 and K9-MT3 were significant predictors of survival time (HR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.8-2.9).

Discussion:
These findings represent a significant advance in the molecular diagnosis of canine mammary tumors. The high sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker panel suggest its potential use as a routine diagnostic tool in veterinary oncology.
