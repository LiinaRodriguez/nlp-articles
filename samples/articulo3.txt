Title: Prognostic Biomarkers in Canine Mammary Cancer: A Systematic Review

Abstract:
This comprehensive review analyzes the current landscape of prognostic biomarkers in canine mammary tumors. We systematically evaluated 25 published studies covering various molecular markers, including hormone receptors, proliferation indices, and angiogenic factors. The analysis revealed that combinations of specific biomarkers provide the most reliable prognostic information.

Methods:
A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We searched major veterinary and oncology databases for studies published between 2015 and 2023. Twenty-five studies meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed for biomarker effectiveness and clinical applicability.

Results:
Key findings include:
- Ki-67 index shows strongest correlation with survival (HR = 2.1, p < 0.001)
- Hormone receptor status critical for treatment planning
- Combined biomarker panels outperform single markers
- Emerging role of microRNA markers
- Novel angiogenic factors show promise

Discussion:
The evidence strongly supports the use of multi-marker panels for prognostication. Ki-67 index and hormone receptor status emerge as the most reliable prognostic indicators. The study also highlights emerging biomarkers showing promise in predicting treatment response and survival outcomes.

Future Directions:
Research should focus on standardizing biomarker assessment methods and developing cost-effective multi-marker panels for routine clinical use.
